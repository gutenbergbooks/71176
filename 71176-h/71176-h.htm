IN ALASKA</p>
</div>
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="fs80">THE THREAT</span></h2>

<p>“The contents of the missive appear to worry
you, Ruth, my love. If that scowl should freeze
on your face, your beauty would be marred forever.”</p>

<p>Stretched full length on the grass beneath a
tree whose branches spread a grateful shade,
Helen Cameron regarded her friend with an
amused and interested smile. As the latter appeared
not to notice her sally, she tried again.</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell me what dreadful news the letter
contains?”</p>

<p>Ruth Fielding thus questioned, looked up
slowly and sighed. She gestured with the hand
that held her letter.</p>

<p>“It’s from that horrid Bloomberg, Helen,” she
said.</p>

<p>“Sol Bloomberg!” Immediately interested,
Helen sat up with a jerk and hugged her knees,
gazing expectantly at her chum. “Don’t tell me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
he, too, has fallen a victim to your charms, Ruthie
Fielding!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly.” Ruth spoke in a vague, preoccupied
voice. “As a matter of fact,” she added
ruefully, “I imagine whatever feeling Sol Bloomberg
has for me is far from a tender one.”</p>

<p>“Then, what on earth is he writing to you
about?” Helen was genuinely curious. “You
aren’t thinking of entering into a business deal
with him, are you?”</p>

<p>Ruth chuckled.</p>

<p>“That deduction is even more absurd than the
first one, Helen Cameron. The mere idea of
doing business with——”</p>

<p>“That hard-boiled cheat?” suggested Helen
amiably.</p>

<p>“Such language! Nevertheless, Sol Bloomberg
is all of that——”</p>

<p>“And then some!” murmured Helen irrepressibly.</p>

<p>“Do you know what he says in this letter?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been trying for some time to find out.”</p>

<p>“He threatens me!” Ruth, sitting cross-legged
on the ground, waved the offending letter for further
emphasis. “He actually has the nerve to
threaten me!”</p>

<p>“So you said before.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are going to be tiresome——”</p>

<p>“I’m not, Ruthie darling. Honest, I’m not.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
I’m only furiously interested. What is our old
friend Sol threatening you for?”</p>

<p>“Spite mostly, I suppose,” returned Ruth, relapsing
once more into her thoughtful mood.
“He wants to frighten me and spoil my pleasure
in the new picture that we filmed at Golden Pass.”</p>

<p>“I hear he has been practically run out of the
pictures,” observed Helen, absently chewing on a
bit of grass.</p>

<p>Ruth nodded.</p>

<p>“And of course he blames that all on me.”</p>

<p>“But how can he?” Helen swept back her
pretty hair in a puzzled gesture. “Surely all his
troubles have been caused by his own cheating and
double-dealing.”</p>

<p>“Of course they have,” Ruth agreed. “It was
Bloomberg, you remember, who lured Viola Callahan
away from the lead in my picture when he
knew to do such a thing at that time would almost
certainly ruin the whole thing——”</p>

<p>“And you fooled him by taking the lead yourself
and making a better leading lady than Viola
Callahan ever could,” chuckled Helen.</p>

<p>Ruth tried to bow, which in her cross-legged
position was rather a hard thing to do. Then
she frowned and fell silent while she reviewed
the details of her quarrel with Bloomberg.</p>

<p>It all began when she engaged Layton Boardman,
an ex-star of Bloomberg’s, to play the lead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
in her new Western picture. Though Bloomberg
and Boardman had quarreled, Bloomberg
really wanted to renew the actor’s contract,
though at a salary that no actor of Boardman’s
reputation would care to accept.</p>

<p>When the Fielding Film Company signed up
Bloomberg’s ex-star at a good salary, the producer
was furious. In retaliation he later tempted
Viola Callahan, Ruth’s leading lady, to come over
to him at a time when Miss Callahan’s desertion
would almost certainly ruin Ruth’s picture.</p>

<p>The fact that Ruth’s picture was not ruined
and to avert the catastrophe she had taken the
lead herself—and successfully—had only served
to increase Bloomberg’s dislike of her.</p>

<p>Bloomberg’s own picture, featuring Viola
Callahan, was a failure. This, coupled with the
unsavory story of his treachery to the Fielding
Film Company, Ruth’s producing company, served
to ruin what shreds of fortune and reputation he
had and practically forced him out of the producing
end of the business.</p>

<p>Ruth supposed, ruefully, that Bloomberg
blamed all his misfortunes upon her because she
had dared to sign up Layton Boardman when the
latter was not under contract to Bloomberg or
any one else and was absolutely free to accept
any offer that was made him.</p>

<p>“I observed,” drawled Helen, after a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
silence, “that you made a love of a
leading lady, Ruthie.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, whether I deserve the compliment or
not!” was Ruth’s laughing reply to Helen’s remark.
“Anyway, the fact remains that despite
all Bloomberg’s crooked schemes and double-crossing
we managed to triumph in the end, while
he——”</p>

<p>“Broke his professional neck,” finished Helen.
“I wish it had been his real one!” she added, with
a fierce look that brought a laugh from Ruth.</p>

<p>“You are getting quite bloodthirsty, Helen
Cameron,” she said. “But at the risk of appearing
bloodthirsty myself, I don’t mind saying that
I wish that something not too dreadful would befall
our rascally friend; enough, at any rate, to
remove him gently from my life at present. I
have quite enough problems to face without
worrying about Sol Bloomberg!”</p>

<p>“Don’t let it bother you, honey,” said Helen,
stretching out lazily again upon the soft grass.
“Just how does he threaten you?” she added, with
a gesture toward the crumpled letter in Ruth’s
hand.</p>

<p>“He says he may bring suit against me,” Ruth
replied.</p>

<p>“Humph! For what?” Helen retorted. “If
anybody ought to bring suit, it’s you, Ruthie.
The man must be crazy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>“I believe he is—with fury,” said Ruth
thoughtfully. “It’s natural for a man down and
out, as Bloomberg is, to rail at the successful, and
in this case he chooses me to vent his spite on.”</p>

<p>“Well, I certainly wouldn’t lie awake nights
worrying about him,” counseled Helen. “What
could a failure like Bloomberg do to you whose
reputation is so well established?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Ruth, playing absently
with the letter. “But this much I can see. I
have made a bitter, vindictive enemy of this man,
and I feel that he will leave no stone unturned to
do me an injury. Anyway,” she added, in a
lighter tone, “I don’t intend to worry until I have
something more substantial to go on than this
letter. It would be a shame to spoil a day like
this—and our ride.”</p>

<p>“Looks as if we weren’t going to get a ride,”
grumbled Helen. She propped herself up on one
elbow and scanned the dusty road that wound
along near the Red Mill. “We appear to be forgotten,
Ruth Fielding. Jilted!”</p>

<p>“Not as bad as that, I guess,” laughed Ruth.
“It really is barely time for the boys, you know.”</p>

<p>Tom Cameron, Helen’s twin brother, and
Chess Copley, Helen’s fiancé, had suggested an
auto ride to the two girls. Since the day was
sultry and hot, the girls had readily accepted the
invitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span></p>

<p>Helen had lunched with Ruth, and now the
chums had repaired to the shaded grounds about
the old house to await the arrival of the boys.</p>

<p>Ruth had decided to peruse her morning mail,
and among the letters had found the annoying one
from Sol Bloomberg.</p>

<p>The letter reminded the girls forcibly of Ruth’s
last venture in motion picture-making in which the
latter had forced her way to success despite the
machinations of this same Bloomberg, and in so
doing had made of the unsuccessful producer a
bitter and revengeful enemy.</p>

<p>Now she tore the paper into tiny bits and with
a challenging little flirt of her fingers scattered
the pieces to the four winds. This accomplished,
Ruth felt better, as though, in the act of tearing
up the letter, she had destroyed the potency of
Bloomberg’s threat as well.</p>

<p>But Sol Bloomberg was not a scrap of paper to
be so easily disposed of. His enmity was something
to be reckoned with, as Ruth was to learn
full well and to her cost in the days to follow.</p>

<p>But now, as Helen called out that the boys were
coming, Ruth put all premonition of trouble from
her mind. For that afternoon at least, she was
determined to leave “shop” behind her.</p>

<p>Tom Cameron had no sooner stepped from the
car than she saw there was some news of an important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
nature for her. He came to her directly
and held out a yellow envelope.</p>

<p>“Telegram,” he said laconically. “They were
just sending it out from the office when I came
along and thought I’d save them the trouble.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Tom,” and then with a whimsical
glance at Helen: “I wonder if this is another
message from Bloomberg!”</p>

<p>The others stood by with interest while Ruth
tore open the yellow envelope. There were so
many changes and surprises in the life of this
talented girl, who combined in one person director,
author and screen actress, that her friends
were kept continually agog with interest.</p>

<p>Ruth’s eyes ran hastily through the message.
She gave a little cry of amazement and thrust the
telegram toward Tom.</p>

<p>“It’s from Mr. Hammond,” she said in explanation
to Chess Copley and Helen. “He is in
business difficulties of some sort——”</p>

<p>“And he wants you to come to New York at
once!” ejaculated Tom, looking up from the telegram.
“Now, Ruth Fielding, what do you intend
to do about that?”</p>

<p>Ruth Fielding sank to the grass and stared
at the others, her forehead wrinkling in a puzzled
frown.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said, in response to Tom’s
question. “There are really a hundred things I
ought to do right here——”</p>

<p>“Oh, there always are, Ruthie,” broke in Helen
flippantly. “You are so busy all the time it makes
me weary just to see you work. Why turn down
a perfectly exciting trip to New York—especially
when duty calls you?”</p>

<p>“Do you really think it is my duty to go,
Tom?” Ruth’s eyes appealed to Helen’s twin
brother as he stood thoughtfully reading over the
telegram. Tom was Ruth’s business partner in
the Fielding Film Company, and since the young
fellow claimed a strictly personal interest in her
as well, the girl had formed the habit of consulting
him in all things.</p>

<p>“I suppose you ought, really,” replied Tom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
“Mr. Hammond has been a very good friend of
yours—of ours—Ruth, and I don’t see how in
the world you can ignore an appeal like this.”</p>

<p>“You see!” cried Helen triumphantly. “I knew
he’d agree with me! That’s what twin brothers
are for!”</p>

<p>“Just what does Mr. Hammond have to say
about his financial embarrassments?” asked Chess
Copley. “Does he go into any details?”</p>

<p>“He can’t very well in a telegram,” Ruth replied.
“Here,” taking the telegram from Tom
and handing it over to Chess, “read for yourself
and form your own conclusions.”</p>

<p>This was the message Helen and Chess read
together.</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Am in great difficulties concerning production
of Girl of Gold. Can you come to New York
immediately? Unable to leave city.”</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">J. A. Hammond.”</span><br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>“The Girl of Gold,” Tom was ruminating
aloud. “Wasn’t that the Western picture there
was such keen competition over?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” returned Ruth eagerly. “The script
was taken from the novel, you know, that made
such a tremendous hit.”</p>

<p>“And the scenes were laid in the gold fields of
Alaska,” Helen added as her contribution. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
remember the book. It certainly was a thriller.”</p>

<p>“The picture ought to be just as good,” said
Ruth thoughtfully. “I know Mr. Hammond
hoped great things from it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what the difficulties are he speaks
about,” said Tom.</p>

<p>Ruth shook her head.</p>

<p>“That we can only find out by a personal interview,”
she said. “But one thing I do know—that
whatever his trouble is, it must be pretty bad
or he would never have sent this hurried call to
me. What shall I do, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I know what you’ll do,” said Helen, with decision.
“You will pack your things and take the
next train to New York. I know Ruth Fielding,”
with a fond little squeeze of Ruth’s hand, “and
my experience of her is, that she never deserts a
friend in distress. How about it, Tommy-boy?”</p>

<p>Since Helen was one of the very first friends
Ruth Fielding had ever had, her prophecy of
Ruth’s future action in regard to Mr. Hammond
was apt to prove a fairly accurate one. For since
Ruth, a little girl of twelve and an orphan, came
to the house at the Red Mill to live with her
Uncle Jabez Potter and his sweet-tempered housekeeper,
Aunt Alvirah Boggs, Ruth Fielding and
Helen Cameron had been the warmest and closest
of friends.</p>

<p>In point of fact, Tom was probably Ruth’s oldest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
friend, since she had met him first and
through him, his twin sister, Helen.</p>

<p>The Red Mill was situated just outside the
town of Cheslow. About a mile away in a handsome
big house Helen and Tom Cameron lived
with their father, who was a widower and
wealthy. In the first volume of the series, entitled
“Ruth Fielding of the Red Mill,” is narrated the
meeting of these young people and their subsequent
adventures.</p>

<p>Uncle Jabez Potter was something of a miser
and a crabbed old soul to boot. However, when
Ruth contrived to save the old man a considerable
amount of money, his heart relented to the extent
of permitting Ruth to enter boarding school with
Helen Cameron. Looking backward, Ruth always
felt that all her good times and adventures
dated from those good old days at Briarwood.</p>

<p>At school and college Ruth’s friends were numerous,
but none were ever quite as dear to her
as Helen. While still engaged in school work,
Ruth developed her talent for scenario writing,
and from that small beginning commenced the
steady climb that was to lead eventually to her
present success.</p>

<p>Ruth’s school and college friends, interested in
the triumphs of their schoolmate and basking in
reflected glory, continued to keep in touch with
her even after the close association of school days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
was at an end. A group of them had come on to
Cheslow to be present at the opening night of
“Snow-blind,” one of Ruth’s recent pictures, which
had proved a tremendous success.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Hammond, owner and director of
the Alectrion Film Corporation, who had first
given Ruth her chance and who had never afterward
failed in kind encouragement and backing.
Even when Ruth, realizing that she had unusual
gifts not only in scenario writing but in directing
as well, decided to break away from Mr. Hammond
and organize her own company, the latter
had backed her project whole-heartedly, evincing
only sympathy and an inspiring belief in her
ability.</p>

<p>Small wonder then that, upon receipt of this
telegram from her old friend telling of his difficulties
and soliciting her aid, Ruth found it practically
impossible to refuse him.</p>

<p>In the volume directly preceding this, entitled,
“Ruth Fielding at Golden Pass,” it was Mr. Hammond
himself who had suggested that Ruth take
the lead when her leading lady, at the instigation
of Bloomberg, deserted the company at the last
minute.</p>

<p>So now her question to Tom, asking for his
advice, was more a matter of form than anything
else. Since the latter had secretly invested a considerable
amount of money in her new and struggling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
little business just when she was most
desperately in need of help, gratitude had been
added to an already warm feeling for Helen’s
twin brother.</p>

<p>There had been an understanding between these
two young people for some time. For Tom’s
sturdy liking for the girl from the Red Mill had
developed into something more ardent as Ruth
grew to womanhood. But as Ruth grew, her ambition
grew also. The temptation to determine
just how far her talent would carry her in the
motion picture business was too great for Ruth
to resist. So while returning Tom’s affection, the
girl put him off time and time again, pleading her
career as an excuse.</p>

<p>Tom was very patient. He could appreciate
Ruth’s enthusiasm, since he himself had become
so vitally interested in pictures. He had as well,
a sincere regard for the girl’s ability.</p>

<p>However, waiting is often very hard, and time
and again it was only Ruth’s appreciation of his
patience and forbearance that kept Tom from
open revolt.</p>

<p>So now it was just another example of this
same patience and forbearance when, in reply to
Ruth’s question concerning Mr. Hammond, he
said without hesitation:</p>

<p>“Of course you’ll have to go, Ruth. Under the
circumstances you couldn’t do anything else.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>Ruth gave him a grateful glance.</p>

<p>“But you will go, too, Tommy-boy? As my
business partner I demand that you accompany
me!”</p>

<p>Tom grinned.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to demand,” he assured her.
“I was going anyway.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll be your chaperon, Ruthie,” said
Helen amiably. “I’m quite sure you need one.”</p>

<p>Ruth chuckled.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether to take that as an insult
or not,” she said. “However, I’d love to have
you come along if you care to.”</p>

<p>So Ruth decided that she would send an answering
telegram to Mr. Hammond, saying that
she would pack that night and start early the following
morning for New York.</p>

<p>Little did Ruth dream as she made the decision
what that trip was destined to bring forth.</p>

</div>

<p>“It looks bad, Jim! Bad! Anyway you
figure it, the result is the same. A financial smash
and the sort of failure that doesn’t do your reputation
any good in the motion picture business!”</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond was seated in the offices of the
Alectrion Film Corporation in conclave with one
of his close business associates, James McCarty.</p>

<p>The latter was a jolly red-faced Irishman with
an habitual smile wreathing his wide, good-humored
mouth. Just now the smile was not in
evidence, in consequence of which James McCarty
bore a rather close resemblance to a sorrowing
kewpie.</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond’s own usually cheerful ruddy
countenance was grave and he puffed absently at
his cigar, now and then beating a nervous tattoo
with his fingers on the edge of his desk. Even
without the confirmation of his words it could be
seen that the head of the Alectrion Film Corporation
was in a state of extreme agitation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>“Anyway you figure it the thing looks bad,”
he repeated unhappily.</p>

<p>“Wish I could disagree with you,” said McCarty,
with a rueful shake of his head. “But I
can’t and still keep my reputation for tellin’ the
truth. You’ve had a streak of bad luck that’s
uncanny, that’s what I call it.”</p>

<p>“And I’d call it something worse than that,”
retorted Mr. Hammond grimly. “There’s the
best director I ever had deserting me just at the
most critical time and going over to the enemy.
I tell you, I’d have thought twice about sinking
so much cash in ‘The Girl of Gold’ if I hadn’t
depended on Baxter to put it across strong.”</p>

<p>“Davidson would have been your next best
bet,” said McCarty mournfully, with a hard pull
at his cigar. “I’ve often said he was pretty near
as good as Baxter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and what does he do just at this time?”
demanded Mr. Hammond bitterly. “Goes and
gets typhoid fever, which puts him out of the picture—literally—for
months to come——”</p>

<p>“And you under contract to produce ‘The Girl
of Gold’ in six months,” finished McCarty.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you the fine old comforter!” said Mr.
Hammond, a touch of humor playing about the
grim lines of his mouth. “You might just as well
pronounce a death sentence over my forty thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t my fault,” McCarty pointed out,
reasonably enough. “I’m just contributing my little
share to the gloomin’ party you started yourself.”
For a moment his grin flashed out, making
him look less like a mournful kewpie. His face
sobered almost immediately, however, as he
added: “Anyway, I’m not sayin’ a thing but the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it!” retorted Mr. Hammond,
the lines of worry furrowed deep in his face. “If
only I could have kept Gordon we might have
inched through some way, though he isn’t nearly
as competent as the other two. But now that he’s
starting for Europe——”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t blame him though,” McCarty
broke in. “It’s his father that’s dying and you
couldn’t have much respect for the lad if he didn’t
rush to the old man’s side.”</p>

<p>“Who’s blaming him?” retorted Mr. Hammond
irritably. “Have I said a word against
him? The only one who is really to blame,” he
added with a grim tightening of his mouth, “is
that man Baxter. And some day I’m going to
have the extreme satisfaction of telling him what
I think of him!”</p>

<p>There was a short pause while both men
thought uncomfortably of the gloomy future.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Hammond looked up, and there
was a new note in his voice as he said quietly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Jim, there’s just one little twinkling light in
all the gloom.”</p>

<p>McCarty gazed at him with interest.</p>

<p>“And would you mind tellin’ me what that is?”
he requested.</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond leaned across the desk, his
steady gaze holding McCarty’s.</p>

<p>“Jim, I think there is one person who can pull
our fat out of the fire—if she will!”</p>

<p>“‘She’?” repeated McCarty, bewildered.
“And now who have you in mind?”</p>

<p>“Miss Fielding,” the other replied quietly. “If
I could get her to direct this picture—I feel sure
she could do it with credit to every one concerned!”</p>

<p>McCarty considered and gradually his expression
became less mournful. A ray of hope shone
through his clouds of depression. Suddenly he
leaned forward, bringing his big fist down on the
table with a decisive thump.</p>

<p>“Say, I bet you’ve struck the right lead, old
man!” he cried. “That girl can swing it if anybody
can. Look at the work she has done
already!”</p>

<p>“Tremendous!” cried Mr. Hammond, delighted
at his friend’s enthusiasm. “Her last pictures are
going across like wild fire. She’s on her way not
only to fame, but wealth.”</p>

<p>“Yeah—that’s just it!” McCarty’s clouds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
depression descended again, almost as black as
before. “What makes you think she is going to
step aside from her own business just to help us
out of a jam? Don’t sound reasonable. Not
human nature—movin’-picture-business human
nature, anyway. No, old man, wake out of your
pleasant little dream. She’d never do it.
Wouldn’t be reasonable to ask her to.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond remained thoughtfully silent
for a moment or two. Then he looked at
McCarty and smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure you’re right, Jim. As you
say, the motion-picture business is more or less
of a cutthroat proposition—but then, so is all
business, for that matter. But I believe that
there are some individuals in the game who are
unselfish enough to reach out a hand to a comrade
in distress. I’m pretty sure—and I’ve known her
for a long time—that Miss Fielding is one of
these.”</p>

<p>Still McCarty shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>“That little lady is running too strong on her
own. You’ll never get her to do it, never in the
wide, wide world!”</p>

<p>It was only a short time after this conference
that another took place in the office of the
Alectrion Film Corporation. Several of Mr.
Hammond’s associates were present, among them
the dubious Mr. James McCarty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>They were all there sitting in solemn conclave
when Ruth Fielding breezed in with Tom.
“Breezed” was exactly the right word for the
manner of her entrance, for Ruth’s rosy face and
bright eyes seemed to bring with them a breath
of the spring day. There was one among the men
who saw her at that moment who straightway
made a mental note that Ruth Fielding was far
too good looking to be the clever business woman
they made her out to be. Good looks, in this
gentleman’s estimation, did not usually go with
brains.</p>

<p>All unconscious of this estimate of herself,
Ruth nodded pleasantly to those in the office she
knew; then put out her hand to Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p>The latter greeted her cordially and the next
moment grasped Tom’s hand in a firm grip. The
two men were great friends, yet now Mr. Hammond
did not disguise from himself that it was
Tom’s negative that he really feared to this
proposition he was about to put to Ruth. He
knew, as most people knew who had come into
intimate contact with the young people, that Tom
had been very patient and had waited a long time
for Ruth to “name the day.” And he could not
but wonder now and with a good deal of trepidation
just how Tom Cameron would view a proposition
that meant inevitably another postponement
of his hopes. Ruth had a very genuine affection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
for Tom, he felt sure, despite her devotion to her
career, and his attitude would unquestionably
influence her decision.</p>

<p>Small wonder then that the justly famous Mr.
Hammond should show a trace of nervous apprehension
as he introduced the two young people to
his colleagues.</p>

<p>“Now sit down, all of you,” he said with a
joviality that was just a bit strained, “and I’ll
outline my little proposition.”</p>

<p>“You said there was some trouble about your
‘Girl of Gold,’” Ruth interpolated. “I was sorry
to hear that.”</p>

<p>“There is trouble, quite serious trouble, Miss
Ruth, as you will see when I am done,” said Mr.
Hammond gravely. “Luck has turned her back
on us completely as producers of ‘The Girl of
Gold,’ and you,” with a quick smile, “appear to
be our only hope!”</p>

<p>Ruth leaned forward with quickened breath.
Just what did he mean by that? She knew that
Tom was watching her thoughtfully and felt a
sudden rush of compunction. Dear old patient
Tom!</p>

<p>But Mr. Hammond was speaking, outlining for
her as he had outlined for McCarty a few days
before conditions as they were at that time with
the Alectrion Film Corporation.</p>

<p>“The whole proposition, boiled down, amounts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
to this, Miss Fielding,” Mr. Hammond concluded.
“Because of a lack of first-class directors
we are literally on the rocks, as you can see, and
we are looking to you, selfishly, no doubt, to
pull our fat out of the fire.”</p>

<p>Ruth drew a long breath and leaned back. Her
cheeks were burning, but her hands, clasped together
in her lap, felt cold.</p>

<p>“Will you do it?” asked Mr. Hammond, and
the other gentlemen, including the dubious
McCarty, leaned forward, staring at her.</p>

<p>“It—it’s a very great compliment you are all
paying me,” Ruth replied slowly. “I—I—” her
voice trailed off and she looked at Tom appealingly.</p>

<p>Tom had been deep in thought, but now his
eyes met Ruth’s with an understanding smile.
His nod, though almost imperceptible, seemed to
raise a thousand-ton weight from the girl’s heart.</p>

<p>She turned to Mr. Hammond, the blood flaming
to her face, her little fist doubled up upon
the table.</p>

<p>“Mr. Hammond,” she cried, with the light of
battle in her eye, “I’ll do it!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br>
<span class="fs80">THE SPY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>This statement of Ruth’s had an electric effect
upon the little group of men in the office. Marcus
Brun, Mr. Hammond’s technical director, leaned
toward the girl with a gleam of genuine admiration
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“You’ll find it anything but an easy job, Miss
Fielding,” he said.</p>

<p>“I’m not looking for an easy job,” replied
Ruth, turning to him quickly. “The harder they
come, the better. And this—well, if I can help
an old friend——” She paused and her eyes
rested for a moment upon Mr. Hammond.</p>

<p>“It means a trip to Alaska, to the Yukon
River,” said McCarty. “The contract calls for
that. No faked-up stuff.”</p>

<p>“I understand—and the pictures will be taken
on and around the Yukon,” answered Ruth firmly.</p>

<p>“It’s a long, hard trip.”</p>

<p>“Many things are hard in this business, Mr.
McCarty.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Hammond gazed at Ruth in intense admiration.
He coughed, and cleared his throat
twice before he could speak, then stretched his
hand across the flat-topped desk.</p>

<p>“Ruth Fielding,” he said, “you’re square!”</p>

<p>It was a great moment for Ruth with all these
important men of the motion-picture world paying
her homage. As Tom looked at her and
realized that this was Ruth Fielding of the Red
Mill, the girl he had grown up with, his pride
in her knew no bounds. He had a moment of
wondering how he had ever found the courage
to ask a girl like this to marry him and give up a
profession in which she was making good so
royally. It would be too bad to waste her talent;
even Tom realized that.</p>

<p>But despite his good sportsmanship and his
acknowledgment of Ruth’s genius, Tom knew that
this new work for Mr. Hammond that she had
just pledged herself to undertake would postpone
their marriage indefinitely. Despite the fact that
he had tacitly given his consent, Tom was sore
at heart and found it a distinct effort to join in
the spirited conversation that then took place
between Ruth and the members of Mr. Hammond’s
official staff.</p>

<p>“‘The Girl of Gold’ is a splendid story and we
ought to make it a still better photoplay,” Ruth
was saying enthusiastically. “I remember what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
spirited bidding there was at the time you bought
the right to film it, Mr. Hammond.”</p>

<p>“The bidding was both spirited and high,” said
the producer ruefully. “The film rights set me
back about forty thousand dollars, Miss Ruth,
and it was that amount we stood to lose in case
you were not in a position at this time to help us
out.”</p>

<p>“But I am,” said Ruth with her quick smile.
“And I feel already like the war horse that hears
the bugle call! I suppose,” with a glance toward
Raymond Howell, the casting director, “you have
an interesting cast.”</p>

<p>“Well, we think so,” responded Howell, with
enthusiasm. “If you are quite willing, Miss
Fielding, we were hoping to sign over Layton
Boardman for the lead. His contract with you
has about run out, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I should lend him to you at all events,” responded
Ruth, with a smile. “I was about to
suggest that he was exactly the type to play
Jimmy Drake.”</p>

<p>“There is another interesting feature.” Mr.
Hammond leaned toward Ruth with an anticipatory
smile. “You remember Edith Lang, the
crippled actress?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” cried Ruth eagerly. “Is it possible
you can use her?”</p>

<p>“Not only possible, but certain,” returned Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
Hammond, smiling at Ruth’s enthusiasm. “She
is a type made to order for the part of the
crippled society woman in the play who eventually
finds out that ‘The Girl of Gold’ is none other
than her own daughter.”</p>

<p>Ruth clapped her hands with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Fine! Fine!” she cried. “Those two alone,
Boardman and Edith Lang, are strong enough to
carry the play on their own shoulders.”</p>

<p>“They won’t have to,” said Raymond Howell,
with conviction. “When you have a chance to
look over our supporting cast, Miss Fielding, I
think you will agree with us that they don’t come
any better.”</p>

<p>Ruth’s eyes were shining. Here was an adventure
after her own heart. Not only had she good
actors to work with, but a fine vehicle as well.
The film version of “The Girl of Gold” was
practically predestined for success because of the
wide popularity of the story upon which it had
been based. And with her own favorite leading
man in the part of Jimmy Drake, the hero of the
play, and Edith Lang playing the heavy emotional
rôle, it seemed that the chances of failure
were so remote as to be scarcely considered.</p>

<p>Yet through all her exultation and excitement,
Ruth felt a tiny ache of conscience when she
thought of Tom. He was being such a sport
about it—as indeed he had been all along. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
could have made it so hard for her to accept Mr.
Hammond’s proposal if he had wanted to. If he
had been irritable or cranky about her work she
would not have minded putting him off so much.
As it was——</p>

<p>She stole an anxious little side glance at him
and was relieved to see that he looked quite cheerful.
He was speaking to Mr. Hammond and his
voice was cheerful too. Ruth could not have
guessed what an effort it was for Tom to make
it so.</p>

<p>“Something has been said about almost everybody
but the young lady that plays the title rôle,”
he was remarking with a humorous look.
“Doesn’t she count?”</p>

<p>“Not so much,” answered Mr. Hammond,
smiling. “Her part is not nearly so exacting as
that of Boardman or Edith Lang, and we have
two or three stars quite capable of meeting the
requirements. We are leaving the selection to
the discretion of our new director here,” turning
with a quizzical smile to Ruth. “I think you will
all agree with me that she has an unusual knack
in the selection of leading ladies!”</p>

<p>Ruth knew he referred to her own part in the
making of her last picture when, upon the defection
of her leading lady, Viola Callahan, Ruth
had stepped into the lead herself.</p>

<p>She flushed now and looked a bit self-conscious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>“The particular leading lady you have in mind
was of your selection,” she reminded him, and
there was a general laugh.</p>

<p>In fact, everything was so pleasant and jolly
that it was some time before they came down to
interesting and important details such as the day
on which the new director was to take charge,
when they were to start on location and so forth.</p>

<p>“You can’t start work too soon to suit us, Miss
Ruth,” said Mr. Hammond. “I presume you are
both free to begin at once?” with a glance toward
Tom.</p>

<p>“The sooner the better,” the latter replied
cheerfully, and Ruth could have hugged him.
That was so exactly the response she would have
made.</p>

<p>“Well, then we might as well get down to
business.”</p>

<p>“I think we’ve been doing business already,”
remarked Ruth.</p>

<p>“You know what I mean, Miss Ruth. About
terms——”</p>

<p>“I’ll leave them entirely to you and Mr.
Cameron,” answered the girl promptly. “You
know Mr. Cameron is the financial head of our
concern,” and Ruth gave Tom a smile that made
his heart jump.</p>

<p>“Well, then, we’ll fix that end up in the morning,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
said Mr. Hammond to Tom. “Now as to
the trip.”</p>

<p>Spreading a map between them on the flat-topped
desk, Mr. Hammond explained the route
they would take, outlining the course of their
travels with a heavy blue pencil.</p>

<p>“Your first real stop will be at Seattle,” he
pointed out. “The picture must be filmed at
various points along the Yukon River. I have
some pictures here of various locations that may
appeal to you and you can settle on some likely
spots without taking the time and trouble of
scouting around on your own account.”</p>

<p>As Ruth accepted the pictures from Mr. Hammond
and looked them over with Tom, she registered
a mental vow that in a short time and with
sufficient capital behind her, the Fielding Film
Company would be run with as much efficiency as
the Alectrion Film Corporation or any of the
other larger producing concerns.</p>

<p>Take these photographs now! What an improvement
that was on the haphazard system of
setting out personally to hunt up locations.
What a saving of time merely to have these pictures
filed away where they might be brought out
at a moment’s notice for reference! Why, one
could choose locations enough for the filming of
the entire picture without actually moving from
the room! However, Ruth thought it would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
possible to stop at just one of these points along
the Yukon—a small settlement, preferably—and
with one such place as a base it ought to be an
easy matter to discover locations in the immediate
vicinity of the settlement that would satisfy
the requirements of the script.</p>

<p>“May we take these with us?” she asked, looking
up from the photographs. “Tom and I will
want to look them over carefully——”</p>

<p>“Of course!” said Mr. Hammond heartily.
“We and everything that’s ours belong to you for
the present, Miss Ruth.”</p>

<p>“Where do we meet the rest of the company?”
Tom asked.</p>

<p>“They have been taking some of the interior
scenes at Hollywood and will meet you at Seattle.
From there you can take a steamer that will carry
you to your various locations up the Yukon. Miss
Ruth—what is it——”</p>

<p>For Ruth had made a sudden dash for the door
and was tugging at it frantically.</p>

<p>“Some one,” she gasped, “is out there spying
on us!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<span class="fs80">AN OLD ENEMY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>While Ruth Fielding had been in conversation
with those in the office she had noticed a curious
thing.</p>

<p>A small triangular corner of glass had been
broken from the upper panel of the door. For
a considerable time Ruth had felt that conviction
that comes to every one at times of being closely
and furtively watched. Her eyes, almost against
her will, had traveled repeatedly to that triangular
bit of broken glass. Then suddenly she saw
it! That at least could not be imagination! An
ear was pressed close to that tiny aperture and
while she stared, momentarily paralyzed with
astonishment, an eye took its place!</p>

<p>With Ruth, to think was to act. No sooner
was she convinced that there was a spy in the
hallway outside the door than she was on her
feet, tugging madly at the knob.</p>

<p>As the startled and astonished men in the office
behind her rose to their feet wondering if she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
taken leave of her senses the door yielded to
Ruth’s frantic tug and swung inward.</p>

<p>That the spy was completely taken by surprise
was evident. The man who had been stooping to
the aperture jerked to an upright position as Ruth
flashed upon him. For a moment he looked
straight at the girl and in that moment Ruth
recognized him.</p>

<p>“Charlie Reid!” she gasped. “What are you
doing here spying?”</p>

<p>“None of your business!” grumbled the fellow
sullenly. “Sol and I know what we’re doing——”</p>

<p>But just then Charlie Reid caught sight of
Ruth’s companions as they hurried to the office
doorway. Turning, he dashed down the almost
empty corridor and, reaching the stairway, took
the steps three at a time and vanished from sight.</p>

<p>“Seemed to be in a pretty big hurry,” observed
Tom. “Didn’t wait for explanations or anything,
did he?”</p>

<p>The men ran to the head of the stairs, but the
fellow had disappeared. To follow him on foot
would be useless, and if they waited for an elevator
they would have no better chance of intercepting
him.</p>

<p>Bewildered and rather alarmed, they returned
to the office to talk over this startling development.</p>

<p>“Not a soul of us saw his face,” mourned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
McCarty, but Ruth was quick to contradict him.</p>

<p>“I did,” she said. “And what’s more, I know
him—and so do you all!”</p>

<p>They made her sit down and explain.</p>

<p>“It was Charlie Reid,” she said excitedly.
“And as you all know, he is Sol Bloomberg’s
right-hand man. It was Charlie who, as agent
for Bloomberg, first tempted Viola Callahan to
break her contract with me.”</p>

<p>“The rascal!” cried Brun, his big hand doubled
into a fist. “And to think he got away with a
whole neck and his information!”</p>

<p>“But why should Charlie Reid want to spy on
us?” asked Mr. Hammond. “Certainly our conversation
has been innocent enough and has nothing
whatever to do with Reid, or with Bloomberg
either, for that matter.”</p>

<p>“It’s queer, though,” mused Ruth, as though
speaking aloud. “Charlie Reid spying here, trying
to find out what he can of my future plans,
right on top of that threatening letter from Sol
Bloomberg!”</p>

<p>Naturally the men were more at sea than ever
over this reference, since none but Ruth herself
and Helen Cameron knew anything of the threatening,
venomous letter Bloomberg had sent.
Ruth had not even told Tom for fear of needlessly
worrying him.</p>

<p>Now, however, it was necessary to make a clean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
breast of the facts. In view of what had just
happened, the letter from the disgraced producer
took on an added importance.</p>

<p>“It looks to me,” Ruth finished, “as though the
planting of Charlie Reid here to spy upon us and
overhear our plans is the first step in Bloomberg’s
scheme of revenge.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t revenge, Miss Ruth; it’s plain spite,”
said Mr. Hammond disgustedly. “That fellow
had nothing against you except that you succeeded
where he tried to make you fail.”</p>

<p>“And something tells me,” Ruth said, with a
little shrug of her shoulders, “that he still has my
failure at heart and will leave no stone unturned
to accomplish it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, with a squaring of his
shoulders and a yearning glance toward the spot
in the doorway where Charlie Reid had been, “if
either Bloomberg or that Reid chap gets ugly
again and tries to start something, we’ll show
them both they’ve been in a scrap!”</p>

<p>On the whole, however, Mr. Hammond and
his associates seemed inclined to treat Bloomberg
and any nefarious schemes he might concoct as
beneath their notice and certainly as nothing to
worry about.</p>

<p>“He may have guns, Miss Ruth, but he has no
powder and shot,” Mr. Hammond assured her.
“In other words, he is a rattlesnake with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
venom removed. Don’t waste your time worrying
about him. And meanwhile,” he put out his
hand as Ruth rose to her feet, “please believe that
we are all undyingly grateful to you for helping
us out in this emergency. I feel as though a
thousand tons had been lifted from my
shoulders.”</p>

<p>Ruth smiled, with a return of the fighting
gleam in her eye.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to be free to undertake it,” she
said. “And—I’ll do my best!”</p>

<p>“That’s all we ask!” Mr. Hammond assured
her, and this sentiment was echoed with many
hearty handshakes by McCarty, Brun and the
others.</p>

<p>After Ruth and Tom had left, there was just
one among the men in Mr. Hammond’s office who
was not enthusiastic over the success of the afternoon’s
conference. This was Raymond Howell,
the casting director.</p>

<p>“I’m not as confident of success as you all
seem,” he told them, and the statement was like
a dash of cold water upon their enthusiasm. “I
admit that Miss Fielding is a good director—upon
her own field. But I don’t know that our
actors will take kindly to a woman director.
They are not used to them, and this one is so
young and good-looking that it seems impossible
that she is as brainy and competent as they say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“As we <em>know</em>,” Mr. Hammond said quietly.
“You have come into our personnel since Miss
Fielding left it, Howell, and that is probably why
you lack confidence in her ability. You said just
now that this girl was a good director in her own
field. You forget that this was her original field,
the stepping stone to her present success. No, my
dear fellow, you may safely lull your fears to
rest. In my own mind I have not the slightest
doubt that this afternoon’s conference has saved
to the Alectrion Film Corporation a full forty
thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>If Ruth had heard this tribute she would have
thrilled with pride at such a proof of Mr. Hammond’s
confidence in her. It would have done
her good too, for, strangely enough, her confidence
in herself had been rather severely shaken
by the detection of spying Charlie Reid that afternoon.</p>

<p>“I don’t like it, Tom. I don’t like it at all,” she
said, as they sped uptown toward the hotel at
which they were stopping while in New York.
“Bloomberg wouldn’t have planted Charlie Reid
there to overhear our conference with Mr. Hammond
if he hadn’t had a good and sufficient
reason.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Tom, looking at her flushed
face and thinking how pretty she was, “Bloomberg
didn’t plant Charlie at all. How do you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
know Reid wasn’t there on his own business?”</p>

<p>But Ruth shook her head positively.</p>

<p>“He has no reason to wish me harm,” she
pointed out. “Except as Bloomberg’s agent.
Besides, I don’t believe Charlie Reid has brains
enough to act on his own account. Bloomberg
was always the brains, Charlie the tool. I wish,”
she ended, a bit plaintively, “I knew what the real
answer was!”</p>

<p>“Now don’t worry,” Tom protested. “If
Bloomberg has any crooked little game up his
sleeve, we’ll find it out soon enough. And when
he starts something we’ll very soon show him who
is going to finish it. You beat him once, Ruth,
and that only goes to show you can beat him
again, and worse.”</p>

<p>A dimple appeared at the corner of Ruth’s
mouth.</p>

<p>“The law of averages——”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother the law of averages,” Tom interrupted,
good-naturedly. “It isn’t going to work
in this case. Besides, here we are at our station!”</p>

<p>He led her forth upon the subway platform
and in a few moments they were being eagerly
greeted by Helen in their suite at the Graymore.</p>

<p>They were to stay over in New York until the
following afternoon at least, since another business
conference with Mr. Hammond was imperative,
for Tom, at any rate. Helen was overjoyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
at this news and declared that she would spend
the following morning shopping for the trip to
the Yukon.</p>

<p>“Do you really think you ought to go?” Ruth
asked, teasing her. “Poor Chess! It really is
cruel to leave him all alone!”</p>

<p>“Oh, but think what a long time we’ll be married!”
Helen protested. “Even Chess couldn’t
deny me this wonderful chance for a little fun before,
before——”</p>

<p>“The end?” suggested Tom, with a grin.</p>

<p>“You put it crudely, Tommy-boy,” chuckled
Helen, making a face at him. “But I simply
couldn’t miss this trip. Especially since our old
friends Bloomberg and Charlie Reid are stepping
into the limelight again, prepared to give us a
few thrills.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder,” said Ruth dryly, as she
examined the location photographs Mr. Hammond
had given her that afternoon, “if we will
have more thrills than we exactly enjoy before we
get through.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<span class="fs80">PREMONITIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Helen stared at her chum for a moment and
her laughing mouth turned downward, lending
an expression of momentary gravity to her merry
face.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say, Ruthie Fielding, that
you are actually afraid of Sol Bloomberg?”</p>

<p>Ruth laid down the pictures and for the
moment her face reflected the gravity of Helen’s.</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> afraid of Sol Bloomberg,” she told them
simply. “Not that I think that he can get the
better of me in a long fight. I believe that when
it comes to a matter of endurance I have a far
better chance than Bloomberg to win.”</p>

<p>“You bet you have, especially when you consider
your wonderful support!” broke in Tom,
with a grin.</p>

<p>“I am considering him,” said Ruth, with a
grateful glance but no relaxing of her gravity.
“That’s one of the things that makes me pretty
sure of winning in a long race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>“But, oh, you don’t realize!” She leaned forward
and cupped her little fighting chin in one
hand while she regarded her companions with an
intense earnestness. “It’s impossible for any one
to understand who isn’t situated as I am how
many small annoyances, little enough in themselves,
but terrible when you group them all together,
a man like Bloomberg can perpetrate. He
knows the picture business through and through,
he knows just how to hit in a vital spot and just
the time to do it. He knows, and Charlie Reid
knows too, that small delays mean actual loss in
dollars and cents. He knows that when a company
of actors is worked up to acting pitch that
just some small delay or the introduction of a
ludicrous incident will sometimes completely ruin
their morale. He knows—but there!” She
checked herself and looked a little embarrassed
at her impassioned flow of words. “I’m going
on dreadfully and you both must think me a regular
kill-joy, but you asked me a question, Helen,
and I’ve answered it the best I know how. I <em>am</em>
afraid of Sol Bloomberg!”</p>

<p>And this fear was in no way lessened during the
busy, interest-filled days that followed.</p>

<p>Ruth might gradually have managed to forget
Bloomberg had that man not taken great pains to
keep himself alive in her memory. The threatening
letter she had received from him just before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
the Charlie Reid incident proved to be only the
first of many.</p>

<p>In the beginning Ruth determined to ignore
these sneering missives. But when they continued
to pour in upon her she laid the matter in desperation
before Tom, and that young gentleman took
a prompt and decisive hand in the game.</p>

<p>He wrote just one letter to Sol Bloomberg,
and though Ruth never knew exactly what the
contents of that letter were, it seemed to have the
desired effect upon her enemy.</p>

<p>Bloomberg’s threatening missives ceased to
come. But they had left their poison in the air
behind them and, day or night, Ruth could never
banish completely from her mind the vision of a
malignant Bloomberg, promising dire things
should she go on with her plans and undertake
the filming of “The Girl of Gold.”</p>

<p>Lucky for Ruth and for Mr. Hammond’s hopes
that hers was a fighting spirit and that opposition
such as Bloomberg’s only made her more determined
to succeed in spite of him.</p>

<p>It had been necessary for them to stay only one
night in New York, since Mr. Hammond, in
eager anticipation of Ruth’s acceptance of his
proposition, anxious as he was to start the serious
work of production without further delay,
accepted Tom’s terms without question and immediately.
He had already planned out all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
details of the trip, to which it remained only for
Ruth to acquiesce.</p>

<p>On reaching Cheslow, reservations were made
at once by Tom on the train that would start the
following morning for New York. The girls,
while in New York, had done all the necessary
shopping—though Helen had taken the heavy
end of this undertaking, since Ruth was far too
absorbed in her plans and in the scenario of “The
Girl of Gold” to care much what she wore on the
trip.</p>

<p>So on this particular evening Ruth was at work
in her little study at the Red Mill, methodically
gathering up all the loose ends of her affairs.</p>

<p>She was leaning over her desk, scanning again
the pictures she had selected of the points they
were to visit along the Yukon River when there
was a slight rustling, and she looked around to
see Aunt Alvirah coming into the room.</p>

<p>“I had to come in and sit with you, my pretty,
just for a little while,” said the old woman, half
apologetically. “I won’t see you for so long and
I never know when you go away on one of these
trips whether you’ll come back to your old Aunt
Alvirah again, or whether she’ll be here to see
you, when you do.”</p>

<p>“Why, Auntie, what a dreadful thing to say!”
Ruth was on her feet in an instant and tenderly
led the old woman to a chair. “You mustn’t talk<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
like that, you know,” taking the wrinkled old
hand in both her young ones and rubbing it gently,
“or I won’t have the heart to go at all!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will, my pretty. And I wouldn’t
hold you back if I could—I’m that proud of you!
But it’s lonesome here at times, and your uncle,
my dear——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know,” Ruth broke in quickly. “I know
just how trying he can be. But you mustn’t let
him worry you, dear. It’s only his age that makes
him so disagreeable, and he really doesn’t mean
half he says——”</p>

<p>“There’s the doorbell!” cried the old lady, as
a shrill clamor woke the echoes of the old house.
“Oh, my back! and oh, bones! Let me go, my
pretty. I must answer it.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see you,” mocked Ruth gayly, as
she pushed the old woman back into the chair
with a firm and gentle hand. “It’s probably Tom,
anyway.”</p>

<p>Ruth started toward the door, but on the
instant there came the click of a latch and Tom’s
cheery whistle sounded within the house.</p>

<p>“Right this way, Tommy-boy,” Ruth called.
“Aunt Alvirah and I are holding a last minute
confab. Join us!”</p>

<p>Tom came in, jaunty and joyful.</p>

<p>“I’ve made reservations all the way through to
Seattle, though we have to change at Chicago,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
told Ruth, after greeting Aunt Alvirah in his
usual hearty way. “And, say, Ruthie, I’ve got a
surprise for you. I’ve reserved a compartment
for you and Helen for the whole trip.”</p>

<p>For a moment Ruth’s face radiated pleasure.
Then it clouded again as she asked anxiously:</p>

<p>“What reservations have you made for Tommy-boy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter about him,” and Tom
grinned. “He gets a lower berth in the Pullman—and
lucky enough not to pull an upper,” he
added, throwing his hat in one chair and himself
in another. “The train is just about packed to
capacity. It’s the flyer, you know, and mighty
popular.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see how you managed to get a
compartment,” Ruth said, puzzled. “You would
think they would all have been snapped up long
ago.”</p>

<p>“So they were—from Chicago out, at any
rate,” said Tom. “But the millionaire diamond
king that had yours changed his plans at the last
minute and relinquished it. Thus my opportunity,
which I grasped with both fists, and then
some.”</p>

<p>“Luxury, thy name is sweet!” sighed Ruth, and
went on with her work of gathering up loose ends.</p>

<p>“Where’s Helen?” asked Aunt Alvirah suddenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>So quiet had the little old woman been, lost
in the depths of the great chair, that Ruth and
Tom had almost forgotten her presence in the
room.</p>

<p>Now they both looked at her with the gentle
consideration they always reserved for the frail
old lady.</p>

<p>“Helen’s at home with Chess,” said Tom, with
a grin. “Holding hands with him and sighing a
last sad farewell.”</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> right hard on Chess,” said Aunt Alvirah
gently. “In my day young ladies didn’t keep
their future husbands waiting around so long.
It don’t—well, it don’t seem quite fair.”</p>

<p>Ruth guessed that this was meant as a gentle
rebuke to her as well as to Helen. She flushed
a little and bent still more intently over her work.</p>

<p>It was Tom who broke the rather awkward
silence.</p>

<p>“Oh, Chess doesn’t blame her,” he said easily.
“Thinks she ought to have all the fun coming to
her before she has to settle down. His chief
worry is that he can’t go along with us. Poor old
Chess, he works too hard. Thing he needs is
to chuck business for a time and take a good long
vacation.”</p>

<p>“When a man is to be married it’s right he
should work hard” said Aunt Alvirah, looking so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
prim and sweet that Tom got up and enfolded her
in a bear hug.</p>

<p>“The thing he ought to do, Auntie,” he said,
resuming his seat and stretching out his long legs
comfortably before him, “is to be like me and get
himself interested in the movies. Then he can
combine business with pleasure and pleasure with
business and everybody’s happy!”</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” said Aunt Alvirah, with a
gentle sigh. “But it wasn’t so in my day, indeed
it wasn’t!”</p>

<p>Not until Aunt Alvirah had gone to bed, complaining
patiently of her back and her bones, did
Ruth broach the subject that was nearest her
heart.</p>

<p>She and Tom were alone, and for a long time
nothing had been said between them. They were
in the habit of falling into these comfortable
silences. A smile touched the corners of Tom’s
wide, good-humored mouth as he watched Ruth
neatly file the last few papers on her desk.</p>

<p>When it was all done Ruth turned around and
answered Tom’s smile in kind.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I’ve told you, Tommy-boy,”
she said earnestly, “just how much I appreciate
the sacrifice you’ve made.”</p>

<p>“Sacrifice?” repeated Tom, understanding but
pretending that he did not.</p>

<p>“You know what I mean,” said Ruth gently.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
“It was big of you to give your consent to my
undertaking this for Mr. Hammond. Not every
one would have done that, under the circumstances,
Tommy-boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m quite a remarkable fellow,” agreed
Tom, with his cheery grin. “But then, so are you
a remarkable young lady, Ruth Fielding,” he
added gravely. “I don’t suppose any one understands
what you are doing better than I, or
appreciates it more. I’m lucky,” with another
grin, just a bit rueful this time, “that you let me
hang around at all!”</p>

<p>But Ruth was suddenly very much in earnest.
She leaned forward and for just a moment let her
hand rest lightly over Tom’s.</p>

<p>“Don’t ever say that again, Tommy-boy,” she
said. “If I have succeeded, so have you. You
don’t know how much you have helped me. Why,
I just wouldn’t know how to go on without you!”</p>

<p>“As long as you feel that way about it, Ruth,”
said Tom, very sincerely touched, “then I don’t
care—a lot—about anything else!”</p>

<span class="fs80">CHESS GOES ALONG</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Despite the fact that she went to bed in a
mood of exhilaration and full of eager anticipation
for the start of the trip, Ruth had an exceedingly
bad night.</p>

<p>She dreamed of Sol Bloomberg all during those
hours when she should have been gathering
strength for the struggle to come.</p>

<p>She woke at last, heavy-eyed and headachy and
with a sense of depression that even the bright
sunlight of a glorious morning did little to dispel.</p>

<p>Uncle Jabez was in an unusually crabbed mood
and inclined to complain about everything, from
the golden eggs, each surrounded by a tempting
little island of white, to the aromatic cup of
strong coffee.</p>

<p>It was perhaps her efforts to soothe the cranky
old man and so make things easier for Aunt
Alvirah that dissipated Ruth’s own blue feelings.</p>

<p>At any rate, by the end of breakfast she was
all on fire with enthusiasm again and impatiently
eager for the sound of Tom’s motor horn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>The sound of the motor horn came just as
she was hugging Aunt Alvirah for perhaps the
hundredth time and promising her all over again
that she would take care of herself and not get
killed in a train wreck or fall overboard from a
steamer.</p>

<p>With a little cry of excitement Ruth reached
for her hat and bag. She was just cramming the
former over her dark hair and had reached for
the latter when Tom flung in at the door.</p>

<p>“Come on, Ruthie!” he cried. “Just time to
make the train. Hullo, Uncle Jabez and good-bye.
Aunt Alvirah, give me a kiss. Yes, I’ll take
good care of Ruth. I will, on my sacred word
of honor! And in addition I’ll see to it that she
writes to you at least once a day, if not oftener.
For that do I get an extra piece of pie when I
come back?”</p>

<p>With such a flood of nonsense did Tom beguile
the little old lady and eventually managed to turn
the tears of parting into smiles. Then he and
Ruth hurried to the car where Helen awaited
them.</p>

<p>“Where’s Chess?” asked Ruth, noticing the
absence of “Lasses.”</p>

<p>“We have to stop and pick him up,” Helen
explained. “He wasn’t ready when we passed
by before. Had to get his bag packed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“‘His bag packed,’” Ruth repeated, puzzled.
“Why in the world would he have to pack his
bag just to see you off?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I forgot you hadn’t heard the latest,”
said Helen, with an innocent air. “Chess is going
with us.”</p>

<p>“Going with us!” repeated Ruth helplessly.
“Isn’t this sudden?”</p>

<p>“Well—er—yes,” agreed Helen, her eyes dancing.
“But then you know Chess is like that—sort
of sudden and unexpected. I think that’s
why he manages to keep me interested most of
the time.”</p>

<p>“Tom, won’t you please explain?” Ruth turned
in desperation to the latter. “Helen is the most
exasperating girl at times. When did Chess
decide to go along with us? You didn’t say a
word about it last night.”</p>

<p>“And for a very good reason,” said Tom, slowing
to a stop before the Cheslow hotel. “When
I got home from your house last night, Ruthie, I
found Lasses still parked on the paternal doorstep.
By the time I had succeeded in running
him off the premises by the nape of his neck——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you did not!” Helen interrupted indignantly.
“I’d like to see you!”</p>

<p>“By the time I had succeeded in kicking him
out,” Tom went on imperturbably, “he and my
kid sister——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>

<p>“Kid sister!” interjected Helen, still indignant.
“When we are twins!”</p>

<p>“Had decided that Chess was to go along.
Ah,” with a welcoming tooting of the horn, “if
I am not very much mistaken, here comes our
good old friend Lasses in the flesh.”</p>

<p>The fact of it was that there was a man in
Seattle who Chess thought it would be good
business to see personally. If he could win over
this man, who was really quite a personage in
the world of finance, to a favorable consideration
of the business proposition Chess had to lay
before him, the young fellow felt, and with justice,
that the expenses of this trip and of many
others like it would be more than offset by the
making of this valuable new connection. Of
course, there was no reason at all why Chess
should go on to Alaska with his friends, except
a natural desire to have one last holiday with
Helen before they married and “settled down.”</p>

<p>Chess carried two suitcases which he declared
would serve him bountifully on the trip.</p>

<p>“All I need is a change or two,” he declared
optimistically, as he flung the grips into the tonneau,
narrowly escaping Helen’s feet. “Plenty
for an unpretentious young fellow like me!”</p>

<p>“You talk as if you were only crossing over
the state line,” Helen retorted. “This is no
overnight journey, I’ll have you know, Chess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
Copley. Seattle is many, many miles away from
here.”</p>

<p>“To say nothing of the Yukon,” added Tom,
as he swung the car about in the direction of the
station.</p>

<p>“Fourteen days from Seattle to St. Michael,”
chanted Helen, as though reciting a lesson. “And
from there overland and by dog sled to the Yukon.
Oh, Adventure, let me hasten to embrace
thee before thou slippest from my grasp!”</p>

<p>“You’ve got your information mixed, Helen,”
said her twin. “There won’t be any dog sled
in this trip. We just keep right on steaming up
the Yukon from St. Michael until we come to
Knockout Point, which is the particular little
jumping off place that’s been selected.”</p>

<p>“I hope there is a doctor on board,” said
Chess, with a mock anxious glance at his fiancé.
“Something tells me we may need his services!”</p>

<p>“Mighty glad you decided to go with us,
Chess,” said Ruth, seeing a revengeful gleam in
Helen’s eye and deciding to change the subject
in a hurry. “I must admit the change in your
plan is something of a shock—though of course
a very joyful one.”</p>

<p>“Well for you that you added that postscript,
woman,” laughed Chess. “You see, Ruthie, it’s
this way. There is some important business to
be attended to——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>“Up the Yukon?” asked Ruth, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Up the Yukon, young lady, as well as in
Seattle, though your very inflection is an insult,”
returned the grinning Chess. “I was going to
send some one else, and then I decided that this
little matter called for really expert attention——”</p>

<p>“Ahem!” loudly from Helen.</p>

<p>“Had an awful time inventing this business in
Alaska, didn’t you, Chess?” and Ruth’s eyes
twinkled.</p>

<p>“And of course, under the circumstances, there
was only one thing to do and that was to send
myself to take care of the job. Simple, what?”</p>

<p>“Very!” said Ruth, with a smile. “And awfully
pleasant. It will make our party quite complete!”</p>

<p>At that moment the auto turned into the street
that led to the station and they saw the train
bowling toward them.</p>

<p>“Just in time!” roared Chess. “Put on steam,
old boy! We don’t want to be left waiting at
the church!”</p>

<p>Tom brought the car to a standstill close to
the platform and jumped out, leaving Chess to
look after the girls and the luggage.</p>

<p>He rushed into the station and found the telegraph
operator, who was an acquaintance of long
standing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p>“Say, do me a favor, Banks, old man, will
you?” he cried. “Take the old bus back home
when you go and leave it in the garage?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Banks. “Gives me a ride
free for nothing. Hurry up, my lad. There
goes the whistle.”</p>

<p>Tom had just time to swing himself up the
steps as the train began to move.</p>

<p>“Pretty close call,” he laughed, as he joined
the others. “Got all your baggage and everything?
All set?”</p>

<p>“All set for the Yukon!” cried Chess jubilantly.
“Already I hear the call of the wild!”</p>

<span class="fs80">A MAGIC TRIP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Maybe it was just Helen you heard, Chess,”
chuckled Ruth, and Helen gazed at her chum reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that I am wild, Ruthie?
How can you? Why, there never was a meeker,
more down-trodden——”</p>

<p>“Write it on the ice!” suggested Chess in
atrocious slang that Helen did not even deign to
notice.</p>

<p>To prevent one of the good-natured squabbles
that so often took place between these two, Ruth
immediately began to talk about their prospects.</p>

<p>“It seems a long enough journey to Seattle,”
she said. “But really that’s only about the first
stage of the journey.”</p>

<p>“Four days and three nights, isn’t it?” asked
Helen.</p>

<p>“The flyer makes it in a little better time,” said
Tom. “But it’s approximately that.”</p>

<p>“Then we meet the others of the company,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
said Ruth, “and take the steamer for St. Michael.
That’s the chief distributing center, you know.
There we’ll have to take a smaller steamer for
the rest of the way.”</p>

<p>“That’s the part I’ll love,” cried Helen enthusiastically.
“It’s always so much more fun to travel
by ship than overland.”</p>

<p>The rest of the trip to New York, though enlivened
by high spirits and merry chatter, was uneventful.
The train arrived not only on time,
but a little ahead of it. Which, for that particular
line, was rather unusual.</p>

<p>They had decided to postpone luncheon until
they were safely established on the western bound
train. Now, as they gathered up wraps and other
belongings in a flurry of excitement, Helen confessed
to an extreme and gnawing hunger.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I can ever wait till we get on
board the train, Ruthie,” she complained plaintively.
“I am really ravenous. If we should pass
a sandwich stand anywhere along the way, don’t
be surprised if I make a wild dash for a frankfurter
and rolls, or some other such delicacy.”</p>

<p>It was necessary for Chess to make a last-minute
rush to the ticket office, since he had made
no reservation. He was lucky enough to secure
an upper berth in the same car with Tom, so that
the party would be pretty close together.</p>

<p>“Lucky you could grab off anything, Chess, old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
boy,” said Tom, as the latter came up to them
panting.</p>

<p>“That’ll be all right,” said Chess. “I’d made
up my mind to come if I had to sleep on the
roof.”</p>

<p>“By comparison the upper ought to be quite
comfortable,” chuckled Helen, and Chess was
heard to murmur something about “having suspected
before that that girl had no heart and
now was quite sure of it.”</p>

<p>Gayly they allowed an obsequious porter—he
was obsequious because Tom had tipped him generously
in advance and commissioned him to let
the young ladies in the compartment lack for no
comfort during the journey—to lead them to their
particular private little cubbyhole which was to
be such a luxury to them on the long trip.</p>

<p>Suitcases disposed of, the girls looked about
them with all the pride of possession.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t this perfectly scrumptious, Ruthie
Fielding?” cried Helen. “I’ll tell you we are
traveling de luxe this time.”</p>

<p>Ruth closed the door of the compartment
against curious eyes and sank down on one of the
cushioned seats which at night could be converted
into fairly comfortable beds.</p>

<p>“It’s all perfectly wonderful,” she agreed with
Helen. “One usually doesn’t expect much privacy
on a train. But, oh, Tom,” with an appealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
glance at the latter, “how about something to
eat?”</p>

<p>“And that time you hit the nail right on the
head, Ruthie,” agreed Tom cheerfully. “I shall
order lunch at once, and unless you young ladies
object to our society——”</p>

<p>“We <em>should</em>,” murmured Helen.</p>

<p>“We will dine right here in comfort——”</p>

<p>“To say nothing of style!” finished Ruth, with
a delighted laugh. “Oh, Tom, please do!”</p>

<p>Tom rang the bell that would summon the
porter and struck an attitude.</p>

<p>“Waiter! The tray!” he declared, and a second
later as though the words and not the bell
had summoned the black genii of the train, there
came a knock upon the door.</p>

<p>Tom sent for a menu card and when it came
ordered what sounded to them all like a sumptuous
feast.</p>

<p>“The boy is good,” said Chess, when the party
was once more alone. “He ordered enough for
another half dozen of us.”</p>

<p>“And I thought this was to be lunch!” sighed
Helen.</p>

<p>However, when the order arrived there proved
to be no more of it than the ravenous young people
could take care of. It was the merriest meal
they had ever had, and that was saying a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
deal, since they had partaken of many merry
meals together.</p>

<p>There was something that appealed to their
imagination in the privacy of the compartment,
in the fact that, aboard that crowded train, they
four could be as much alone as though they were
in the dining-room of the house at the Red Mill.</p>

<p>Even the train itself seemed enveloped in the
same glamorous mist—a sort of dream train,
speeding them on toward romance and adventure.</p>

<p>The illusion continued during all of that long
journey across the continent. Never once did
their spirits flag or that utter boredom that is so
often the accompaniment of a long trip descend
upon them.</p>

<p>Chess and Tom declared that they were perfectly
comfortable in the Pullman coach, and as
for the girls, they slept as soundly as though they
were back in their own familiar beds at home.</p>

<p>The delight of dining alone in a stateroom
never palled, and they whiled away the long daylight
hours of the journey reading or chatting or
discussing with Ruth the filming of Mr. Hammond’s
picture, “The Girl of Gold.” Ruth herself
spent many hours in studying both the novel
and the scenario.</p>

<p>As the scenery became more rugged and beautiful
they spent more and more time on the observation
platform, sometimes only leaving it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
when hunger drove them inside to appease their
appetite.</p>

<p>Occasionally the train stopped long enough at
way stations to permit of their stretching cramped
legs and lazy muscles in a short walk. They
never failed to take advantage of these occasional
breaks and always came back to the train
with an increased eagerness to be on their way.</p>

<p>It was only at Chicago that an incident occurred
that sufficed to shatter Ruth’s enjoyment
of the trip for a time.</p>

<p>In the city of the lakes it was necessary for
them to change trains for points still farther
West. Tom had secured a compartment for the
girls on the second train, as well, so that the
change was actually only a matter of shifting
their baggage and themselves from one train to
another.</p>

<p>But when they were on the platform and just
about to board the Seattle train, Helen suddenly
hissed a sentence in Ruth’s ears that made the latter
stand still as though she had been shot.</p>

<p>“That’s our old friend Charlie Reid, Ruthie!
Look quickly! Directly back of you!”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br>
<span class="fs80">CHARLIE AGAIN?</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ruth looked, but not in time to see the face
of the person Helen pointed out. To be sure, the
back looked familiar and the walk was strongly
reminiscent of Charlie Reid. But she could not
be sure.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it?” hissed Helen, as at the heels of
their porter, the boys bundled them into the train.</p>

<p>Ruth was flushed and excited. She shook her
head.</p>

<p>“I only saw his back, Helen. I—don’t know!”</p>

<p>No more was said about it until the girls were
safely established in their new quarters and
Chess and Tom had excused themselves to find
their own seats in the sleeper.</p>

<p>“I’m sure it was Charlie Reid, Ruth,” said
Helen then. She herself was tremendously excited,
though her emotion was of a different kind
from Ruth’s. To Helen this unlooked-for appearance
of Charlie Reid—if indeed it were he—meant
a break in the monotony of the train trip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
and a little added interest in things in general.
While to Ruth, the possibility that they had been
trailed so far by Charlie Reid meant only one
thing. And that was that Sol Bloomberg was still
determined on harming her in some way.</p>

<p>“If that was really Charlie Reid,” she said
tensely, “then I might just as well bid good-bye
right now to my peace of mind, Helen. Before
long it will be gone entirely, broken into a thousand
pieces.”</p>

<p>“Which—your peace of mind or Charlie?”
asked Helen flippantly.</p>

<p>She came and sat beside Ruth and patted her
hand in a manner that was meant to be soothing
and only served at the moment to irritate the
harassed young director.</p>

<p>Ruth drew her hand away as gently as she could
and with a resigned gesture put back a lock of
hair that had become dislodged.</p>

<p>“You can laugh all you like, Helen,” she
sighed. “But I can tell you, Sol Bloomberg is
nothing to laugh at, and if he has set his little
hound on my trail, it behooves Miss Ruth Fielding
to watch her step!”</p>

<p>“I’ll trust you for that,” said Helen.</p>

<p>Seeing that Ruth was really disturbed she did
her best to mend the situation.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it wasn’t Charlie Reid after all,” she
suggested, though in her heart she was almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
sure that it was. She, at least, had obtained a
fairly good view of the man’s face. “It was dim
in the station, anyway, and Charlie Reid has a
rather ordinary type of face. I suppose there
are thousands of them scattered all over the
world.”</p>

<p>But despite Helen’s loyal attempts to get her
friend’s mind off the subject, that day was completely
spoiled for Ruth.</p>

<p>It was decided by the two girls, at Ruth’s suggestion,
that they should say nothing concerning
their suspicions to the boys just then.</p>

<p>“Time enough when we are sure we are being
followed,” said Ruth, and Helen agreed with her
that there was really no end to be gained by
speaking of the incident.</p>

<p>Even had they been right in identifying the man
they had glimpsed on the platform as Charlie
Reid, neither Ruth nor Helen could advance any
theory as to why the fellow was following them.
But they knew that if this was indeed Ruth’s
enemy, he would sooner or later reveal his purpose
to them, and they were in no hurry for that
time to come.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, as time went on and their
journey neared a close, both Ruth and Helen became
nearly convinced that it was not Charlie
Reid they had seen in the station at all. For the
person they had thought was Reid had certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
boarded the train with them. Knowing this, the
girls made repeated excursions throughout the
length of the train and examined every passenger
closely while, at the same time, not appearing to
do so.</p>

<p>But they saw no sign of Charlie Reid. Either
he had boarded the train and left it at the very
next stop or he was keeping himself well hidden.</p>

<p>The failure to see anything of Reid helped
drive the unpleasant incident from Ruth’s mind,
and by the time they reached Seattle, Bloomberg
had once more faded into a rather dim background.</p>

<p>The morning on which they were due at their
destination found them really sorry to terminate
their Arabian Nights’ train trip.</p>

<p>“I never had so much fun,” sighed Helen, as
they sat among freshly packed grips with their
hats and wraps close at hand. “After this no one
can ever tell me that traveling is a bore. I shall
contradict them rudely!”</p>

<p>“It has been a lark,” Ruth agreed. “I’ve felt
all along as though we were riding in a private
train.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you will be some day; who knows,”
said Tom, with a smile, and Ruth’s own quick
smile answered it.</p>

<p>“Not for a considerable time yet, Tom, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
ever,” she said. “But it is sort of fun to play
with the idea, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“May I ask what plans your August Highness
has made for us, once we reach Seattle?”
asked Chess.</p>

<p>“Tom knows. He does all that sort of thing
for me, you know,” said Ruth, with a grateful
glance at the young fellow. “We are stopping
at the Tevor-Grand, aren’t we, Tom—there to
meet the rest of the crowd?”</p>

<p>Tom nodded and Helen said eagerly:</p>

<p>“Who are the crowd, Ruth? Will there be
many?”</p>

<p>“About twelve actors, three cameramen and
two directors,” said Ruth, looking remarkably
businesslike as she counted them off on her fingers.
“There will be quite a company of us—and all
picked players at that.”</p>

<p>“But why two assistant directors?” Helen
asked. “I should think you were a dozen all
rolled into one, Ruthie.”</p>

<p>“She is the big one, of course,” Tom explained,
a proud note in his voice.</p>

<p>“The big cheese, the whole works, so to speak,”
Chess interpolated.</p>

<p>“Just about,” returned the grinning Tom.
“These two other directors are merely understudies,
you understand, directing the minor scenes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
and otherwise taking some of the load off her
shoulders.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t think they would enjoy being
bossed about by a girl,” said Helen. She had
spoken impulsively and was instantly sorry when
she saw a shadow of uneasiness cross Ruth’s face.</p>

<p>“That has worried me just a little,” Ruth confessed.
“A woman director is at a disadvantage
with a man because the men in the company always
seem to go on the assumption that she’s no
good until she proves the contrary. There are
good woman directors in the moving picture business——”</p>

<p>“Ladies and gentlemen, the proof is right before
your eyes,” murmured Helen with a mischievous
glance at Ruth.</p>

<p>“But they have always had to work twice as
hard to prove their ability as a man in the same
position,” finished Ruth.</p>

<p>“All the more credit to the woman when she
gets there, then,” said Helen.</p>

<p>Ruth smiled.</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t make the fight any the
easier,” she pointed out.</p>

<p>Tom was about to reassure her on this point
when there was a knock on the door. It was the
porter to announce that they were just slowing
into Seattle and to get their suitcases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span></p>

<p>Chess gave a whoop of joy and grabbed up his
hat.</p>

<p>“All ashore that’s going ashore,” he chortled,
dropping the hat long enough to put Helen’s on
her head hindside before, at which the young
lady was tremendously indignant. “Follow me,
ladies and gentlemen, and I will show you the
sights of this famous seaport——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Chess, do hush!” cried Helen, as they
joined the tide of humanity sweeping down the
aisles. “Every one is looking at you.”</p>

<p>“Might as well give ’em a treat,” replied that
youth, with irrepressible good humor. “No one
ever accused me of having a stone where my
heart ought to be!”</p>

<p>Chess’s high spirits were infectious, and before
they reached the street and a taxicab they
were all weak with mirth. Chess could be irresistibly
funny when he wanted to, and this was
evidently one of those occasions.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you glad we brought him along?”
Helen asked of her chum, regarding her fiancé as
if he were some strange kind of animal. “As a
circus clown, I declare he can’t be beat—oh, dear
me, Chess, do ask that taxi driver to be a little
more careful! That time he tried to upset a
truck.”</p>

<p>“Let him have his fun if he likes it,” Chess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
returned imperturbably. “He’s entitled to a little
recreation in his off hours.”</p>

<p>Despite the seemingly reckless driving of the
chauffeur through traffic that was nothing short
of murderous, the four young people managed to
reach the Tevor-Grand Hotel whole and in their
right minds.</p>

<p>Tom, as usual thoughtful and reliable, had
wired ahead for rooms, and upon registering his
little party at the desk was treated by the deferential
clerk in charge with as much civility as though
he had been an old patron of the hotel.</p>

<p>When Ruth asked about the company, mentioning
the names of the directors, she was informed
that they had arrived only a short time before.</p>

<p>Two porters caught up their luggage and Ruth
turned with the others toward the elevators.
Suddenly she gave a little gasp and stood still,
her eyes traveling across the lobby to the door of
the writing room at the farther side.</p>

<p>“Am I dreaming?” she cried. “Or was that
really Charlie Reid?”</p>

<span class="fs80">A TANTALIZING GLIMPSE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Helen, being close at Ruth’s side, was the
only one to hear the latter’s startled, half-whispered
exclamation.</p>

<p>By the time Tom and Chess had noticed the
defection of the two girls and had started back
toward them, Ruth had recovered her composure.</p>

<p>“What’s the idea of holding up the parade?”
Chess demanded jovially.</p>

<p>“Is there anything you want? If so I’ll get it
for you,” Tom added.</p>

<p>“Oh, millions of things, Tommy-boy,” Helen
cried before Ruth could speak and so betray her
agitation. “That really was a very rash promise,
but we won’t take you up on it. What we want
most right now is rest and privacy and perchance
a bite of refreshment. Lead on, lead on!”</p>

<p>Ruth was grateful to her chum for so disguising
her own agitation and dismay. Helen’s continuous
chatter as they were carried up in the
elevator prevented either Tom or Chess from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
noticing or commenting upon her rather tight-lipped
silence.</p>

<p>The elevator stopped and they followed the
porter down a rather dark and gloomy corridor
richly carpeted so as to muffle the heaviest footfall.</p>

<p>They went first to the girls’ rooms. A key was
slipped into a lock and they entered the regulation
hotel room, rather stuffy and gloomy, though
comfortably furnished, with a bath attached and
a door leading off into a smaller room. In the
larger of the two rooms the bed wore the disguise
of a cretonne-covered couch, thus transforming
the bedroom into a rather attractive sitting
room during the daytime.</p>

<p>“Here’s your reception room, Ruth,” said Tom,
“where you can meet your actors and confab to
your heart’s content. Like it?”</p>

<p>“All perfectly lovely, Tom dear, although we
really didn’t need the extra room. Still it will
be lovely, having the two,” she added quickly,
unwilling to spoil Tom’s satisfaction. “It gives
one space to move about in.”</p>

<p>“And now,” said Helen, making a face at the
boys, “clear out of here, both of you! I know
Ruthie wants to rest for a while before she has
all that crowd of actors and cameramen and what
not coming down on her!”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Chess, looking doleful, “that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
business must spoil our pleasure some time. Why
not now!”</p>

<p>Ruth laughed.</p>

<p>“It will be pretty nearly all business with Tom
and me from now on,” she said. “But that
needn’t prevent you and Helen from having all
the good times you like.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” sighed Helen. “But Chess’s
business will stand horribly in the way of pleasure.
I presume for a while I’m doomed to play
all by myself. Hustle your old man, will you,
Chess?”</p>

<p>“If he’s to be hustled, yes. But his kind are
sometimes annoyingly deliberate.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, go to it, you busy bees, and I will
laze gloriously while I look on with pity for all
of you. Me for a show this afternoon.”</p>

<p>When the boys had gone to their rooms, only
a door or two further down the corridor, Helen
asked Ruth if she had really seen Charlie Reid
in the hotel lobby.</p>

<p>“I can’t be sure,” Ruth answered, her voice
low and troubled. “I just caught a glimpse of a
man that looked like him, but as I turned around
he dodged into the door of the writing room.”</p>

<p>“That would seem to show that it was really
Charlie Reid you saw,” Helen pointed out. “For
Charlie would surely be careful about letting you
know he was following you just yet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what I thought,” agreed Ruth, a little
wearily. “Anyway, I wouldn’t say anything about
it to the boys for a while, Helen. We’ll wait
until Charlie really does something before we
complain. Besides, I can’t even be sure it was
Charlie I saw. It may be that I’m thinking of
him so much that I just naturally see him about
me wherever I go.”</p>

<p>“Let’s hope that’s the answer, Ruth dear,” said
Helen, going over to her chum and giving her a
warm kiss. “In the meantime don’t go worrying
your head about it. The two of us together are
more than a match for Charlie Reid!”</p>

<p>Ruth was rather glad that Helen had planned
to go to a matinée, for that left her perfectly
free to attend to the very important business at
hand—that of meeting and becoming acquainted
with the actors, cameramen and assistant directors
with whom she was to be so closely associated
during the next few months.</p>

<p>They began to gather in her room shortly after
two o’clock.</p>

<p>Edith Lang came first, accompanied by Layton
Boardman, and these two both Ruth and Tom
met with enthusiasm. They had been associated
with the two actors in the making of Ruth’s last
picture at Golden Pass and had liked and admired
them immensely.</p>

<p>Boardman, who had taken the lead in Ruth’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
picture, was a splendid actor of Western parts
and a fine fellow as well. Edith Lang was the
crippled actress who had given Ruth valuable
pointers in an art in which she herself was very
proficient.</p>

<p>Crippled as she had been while engaged in Red
Cross work during the World War, and so more
or less exiled from a profession that had been the
breath of life to her, Edith Lang had once more
come into her own.</p>

<p>Her part as the cripple in “The Girl of Gold”
was a heavy emotional one, calling for exactly the
type of acting which had made Edith Lang famous.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you how happy it makes me to see
you again,” she told Ruth, grasping the latter’s
hands in both her own. “And under such very
happy circumstances! My dear Miss Fielding,
can you imagine slowly starving to death and then
having presented to you a feast sumptuous beyond
your wildest imaginings? That is what this rôle
means to me!”</p>

<p>There were others gathering in the doorway,
and Ruth went to meet them eagerly.</p>

<p>There were the two assistant directors, Gerard
Bolton and Maurice Brandt. The former was a
stockily built man with extremely broad shoulders
and a forehead that jutted heavily over deep-set
gray eyes. It was the forehead, Ruth decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
after a second look, that made him look so pugnacious,
as if, having once got hold of an idea, he
would be extraordinarily slow to relinquish it.</p>

<p>However, he was pleasant enough, and his companion,
Maurice Brandt, was extremely talkative
and cordial.</p>

<p>Ruth decided that Maurice Brandt might prove
a trifle too self-assertive upon further acquaintance,
and then and there prepared to resist him
with some self-assertiveness of her own.</p>

<p>The leading lady was Alice Lytelly, a fluffy little
blonde who ought to do well in the rather unexacting
title rôle. Despite the gushing greeting
of the latter, Ruth read temperament in the
stormy blue eyes of the star and the pouting, too-full,
red lips. Ruth had had experience before
with temperamental stars, and she knew just how
to catalogue Miss Lytelly.</p>

<p>There were others in rôles of varying importance,
from the tall, distinguished-looking
“father” of the heroine and the pitiful, humpbacked
dwarf who played the villain of the piece
to the lad of eleven, freckle-faced and elfish,
who took the part of the star’s younger brother
and who by his astuteness and precocity managed
to discover the designs of the villain and lead the
hero to his hiding place.</p>

<p>This youngster, by name Eben Howe, was to
become, as Tom teasingly said, his rival in Ruth’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
affections. However much that may be an overstatement
of fact, it certainly is true that Ruth
liked the mischievous, freckled boy at sight and
that Eben developed an adoration for the young
director of the company that was like the devotion
of a good-natured, tail-wagging collie dog.</p>

<p>Such was the general personnel of the company
of actors Ruth was to direct in a moving picture
of the first magnitude, “The Girl of Gold.”</p>

<p>The three cameramen, Traymore, Schultz and
Atwater, were all pleasant and competent men,
and Ruth felt instinctively that there would be
little friction in her association with them.</p>

<p>Artists, every one of them in their line—in this
day of the “super-film,” there is a great deal more
importance to the work of the cameramen than is
generally suspected—they all had heard of her
and respected her ability and had decided to give
their best in service to their youthful “chief.”</p>

<p>Ruth felt this and was grateful for it. But
about the actors and the two directors, she was
not so sure. She seemed to sense a slight undercurrent
of resentment toward her—partly, perhaps,
because of her youth, partly because of her
sex.</p>

<p>But it was in the person of the dwarf that this
resentment seemed to crystallize. Ruth shuddered
merely to look at the deformed, twisted
body of Joe Rumph. Once she caught his deep-set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
black eyes gazing intently at her from under
beetling brows and beneath that somewhat sinister
look her flesh actually crawled as though some
slimy creature had trailed its length across her.</p>

<p>When it was over and they had all gone off, informed
of Ruth’s plans for the morrow’s start,
Ruth flung herself into a chair and pressed a hand
over her eyes as though to shut out some unwelcome
vision.</p>

<p>Tom, who had been thoroughly enjoying himself
and who had found a kindred spirit in one
of the jovial cameramen, Bert Traymore, looked
surprised at Ruth’s strange gesture. He came
over to her anxiously and rested a hand on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Buck up, Ruth,” he said. “What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“That horrid Joe Rumph,” cried Ruth, in a
muffled voice, hands still pressed close before her
eyes. “Did you notice how he looked at me? I
don’t like him, Tom! Why, I’d just as soon take
a venomous snake along with the company as that
man!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<span class="fs80">A CHANCE REVELATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Tom Cameron laughed at Ruth’s statement
and tried to reassure her. But Ruth could not
be shaken from her stand.</p>

<p>“Rumph dislikes me and mistrusts me for some
reason, Tom,” she insisted. “I have not been in
this profession so long, meeting all types and kinds
of people, without learning a few things—and
one of them is to be able to judge pretty accurately
the attitude of my actors toward me. You don’t
know how sensitive a director is to atmosphere,
Tom. I suppose he has to traffic so much in emotions,
both artificial and real, that he becomes
supersensitive to them. Anyway, I know I can
always tell whether an actor has confidence in me
and whether he is working for or against me.
And this dwarf, Rumph, is going to work against
me every inch of the way! Of that much I am
sure!”</p>

<p>Ruth had removed her hands from before her
face and was sitting with them clasped tightly in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
her lap. She leaned toward Tom and spoke with
an earnestness that could not fail to impress him.
He had learned long ago to place trust in Ruth’s
almost uncanny gift of reading people and motives.
She seemed to know sometimes what her
associates were going to do and how they were
going to do it almost before they were aware of
their own designs.</p>

<p>So on this occasion he looked grave and troubled
and put one of his own big hands over her
clasped ones.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry you feel this way, Ruth,” he said.
“It seems to me Rumph plays a pretty important
part in the picture. It would be rather hard to
get along without him, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>To his surprise Ruth shook her head vehemently
in the negative.</p>

<p>“Not the way I see it,” she said. “I have
watched this—this afflicted creature work in other
pictures, and he has never failed to make me sick
with mingled pity and loathing. I have always
felt—I may be wrong, but I don’t believe so—that
the audience agreed with me. People go to the
moving pictures to be amused and, in some cases,
edified, but they don’t go to see monstrosities. It
seems to me that it offends the ordinary normal-minded
person to see a deformity, such as
Rumph’s, exploited, brought into the limelight.
It seems to me—and again I may be wrong—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
I could make a far more striking, more powerful
picture without Joe Rumph than with him.”</p>

<p>“But the book!” protested Tom. “It is necessary,
isn’t it, to make the film production as near
like the finished story as possible?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Ruth. “But if you will remember,
the villain of the novel was no such deformed
creature as Rumph. He had been crippled,
it is true, in a railroad accident and his spine
so hurt that he would always be a marked man,
but he was no such repulsive animal as this
Rumph!”</p>

<p>Ruth shuddered again and Tom laughed ruefully.</p>

<p>“I must admit myself he isn’t any beauty,” he
said, beginning to stride up and down the room.
“But if you should get rid of Rumph what would
you do for a villain? No ordinary actor could
take that part, you know.”</p>

<p>“No,” admitted Ruth simply. But there was
the queer little secret look in her face that Tom
had often surprised there when Ruth was seized
by inspiration. “No ordinary actor could. But—have
you noticed Carlton Brewer?”</p>

<p>“The one who plays the hero’s best friend—the
spineless, good-natured, devoted lad whose
idiocy is always getting him into laughable
scrapes?” Tom wanted to know.</p>

<p>“The same,” said Ruth, her eyes half-closed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
dreamy contemplation of some vision that only
she herself could see. “His part in this picture is
not impressive, I’m bound to admit, but I am convinced
that that boy would make a great actor if
he had only half a chance.”</p>

<p>“But the cripple part of it,” Tom protested.
“Carlton Brewer is one of the best set-up lads I
ever saw.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tommy, Tommy, you’re funny,” cried
Ruth, laughing a little with suppressed excitement.
“Do you mean to tell me that you have
been connected with this profession this long without
learning that with a little artificial make-up
the straightest back can be bent and a most convincing
screen cripple made? And incidentally
Abe Levy—did you notice him? The little good-looking,
curly-haired Jew with the cheerful smile—is
one of the cleverest make-up men in the profession.
I’m willing to bet that with a little coaxing
on my part he could make the loveliest cripple
out of Carlton Brewer that you ever saw!”</p>

<p>Tom stopped before her and gazed down at
her with that slightly bewildered, wholly admiring
wonder that was a part of his affection for
the girl.</p>

<p>“I believe anybody would do almost anything
for you when you look like that, Ruth Fielding!”
he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>She made a little face at him and for a while
they relapsed into a thoughtful silence.</p>

<p>At last Tom said:</p>

<p>“If you feel that way about it, I’d be willing to
back your judgment to the limit. Mr. Hammond
has given you full leave to exercise your discretion.
Why don’t you discharge Rumph and have
it over with?”</p>

<p>But Ruth shook her head, a shadow once more
clouding her face.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” she said. “I don’t want to make
any radical change until I feel that I have the
full confidence of my company. And it may take
me some time to win that, Tom!”</p>

<p>If Ruth could have been present at a conference
of some of her actors and directors in Layton
Boardman’s room, she would have found her
forebodings justified.</p>

<p>Gerard Bolton was speaking at the moment.</p>

<p>“She’s clever, all right,” he admitted. “You
can see that. But I doubt if she has the ability to
handle a picture like ‘The Girl of Gold.’”</p>

<p>“She can do it if any one can,” said Layton
Boardman. “Look at the work she did in ‘Snow-blind’
and this last picture at Golden Pass.”</p>

<p>“She is one of those rare people,” Edith Lang
spoke up, also in Ruth’s support, “who have the
imagination and ability not only to write the script
of her plays but to direct the filming as well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“She did not write the script for ‘The Girl of
Gold,’” Bolton pointed out.</p>

<p>“No, but I believe she thoroughly understands
it,” Edith Lang flashed back at him.</p>

<p>“That,” retorted the director, with a cynical
lifting of eyebrows, “remains to be seen!”</p>

<p>“I don’t like working under the direction of a
woman, never did!” It was the growling tones
of Joe Rumph that broke into the conversation.
“I don’t know what the boss was thinking of to
put a kid like that over us! It’s my belief that
this whole thing’s going to be a complete flop!”</p>

<p>There was a deep and significant silence while
the others looked at him. The dwarf was not
popular with his fellow actors. For, where his
terrible deformity might have excited pity, his
rough manner and bitter words rejected it. But
at this moment, despite the loyal defense of the
two actors who had worked with Ruth in her last
picture, the consensus of opinion was with Joe
Rumph.</p>

<p>From all appearances, Ruth Fielding’s road to
success on this occasion was to be by no means
an easy one!</p>

<p>However, the next day, which was to mark the
start of the journey to the Yukon, dawned hopefully
clear and bright and Ruth awoke with a
tremendous enthusiasm to start on her great adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>Helen was lazy and hard to get up.</p>

<p>After her matinée Helen had done a little
window shopping. She was delighted with the
great stores, saying that they reminded her of
those in New York, only that they were “much
more fascinating.”</p>

<p>When Chess came back to the hotel from his
business interview, jubilant and declaring that he
had “landed his big fish,” Helen was waiting for
him and still blissfully employed in happy mental
contemplation of gorgeous shop windows.</p>

<p>She was very enthusiastic about his good news,
however, and gayly agreed to dine sumptuously
with him and go that evening to the best show in
town in honor of the great occasion.</p>

<p>Small wonder, then, that morning found her
still sleepy and in no mood to hurry, as Ruth
begged her to.</p>

<p>“You might let a fellow be,” Helen murmured
reproachfully, as she succeeded with great effort
in getting her second eye open.</p>

<p>“I’ll let you be in earnest if you don’t get busy
and hustle,” Ruth retorted, as she combed her
pretty hair and wound it neatly about her head.
“Are you aware that our steamer leaves Seattle
promptly at nine-thirty? Perhaps,” she added innocently,
but with mischievous intent, “you and
Chess like Seattle so much that you would like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
to stay here and not go to the Yukon with us,
after all!”</p>

<p>With deep resignation Helen got up then and
looked sleepily for her shoe under the bed.</p>

<p>“You can be the most cruel thing when you
want to, Ruthie Fielding,” she complained.
“Sometimes I just don’t know how I go on loving
you at all!”</p>

<p>It was only after a wild scramble on Helen’s
part—and on Ruth’s, too, since she was forced to
pack Helen’s grip as well as her own—that they
succeeded in reaching the dock in time to board
the steamer.</p>

<p>Ruth found her company at the wharf before
her and was relieved to find, as the gangplank was
drawn up, that no one had been left behind.</p>

<p>“Except Joe Rumph,” she whispered to Tom,
as the space slowly widened between the ship and
the wharf. “I think I could have been quite content
to have left <em>him</em> behind!”</p>

<p>The bustle and activity of the harbor was an
inspiration in itself. Ruth’s eyes sparkled as she
gazed out over the busy scene. Ships of all sizes
and descriptions crowded the port. Except for
the addition of many lumber boats, Ruth might
almost have imagined herself back in New York,
gazing out over lower New York Harbor.</p>

<p>The steamer was crowded and it was with difficulty
that Tom kept his little flock together. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
managed to get them all safely established finally
in the staterooms he had reserved for them, and
then came back to rejoin Ruth, who had lingered
on deck, watching the shipping on Puget Sound.</p>

<p>“Some crowd, eh?” he greeted her buoyantly,
as he fought his way through to her side. “This
is the Yukon’s open season, and it seems as if the
whole world had taken advantage of the fact.
What are you thinking about so deeply, Ruth?”</p>

<p>For answer Ruth put a hand upon his arm and
held up a finger warningly.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>Somewhere behind them a laughing voice came
clearly to their ears.</p>

<p>“Wonder if we’ll run into Sol Bloomberg on
this trip?”</p>

<p>“Sol Bloomberg!” returned another voice, surprised.
“What’s the idea?”</p>

<p>“Why, hadn’t you heard?” The first speaker
was evidently incredulous. “Bloomberg has gone
to Alaska.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br>
<span class="fs80">DISHEARTENING NEWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a moment it seemed to Ruth as though her
heart sank down into the toes of her shoes.</p>

<p>Sol Bloomberg in Alaska! And they were going
there! Instead of leaving him farther and farther
behind with every mile they had traversed,
as she had fondly hoped, their journey was taking
them steadily nearer to a possible meeting with
him, with the man who had vowed “to get even
with her if it took him the rest of his life!”</p>

<p>Ruth turned on impulse to face the two
speakers. She had thought she recognized the
voices, and now she saw that she was right.</p>

<p>They were two minor actors of the company.
While not taking any important part, they were,
nevertheless, practically invaluable to the company
because of their ability to “fit in” at odd and
sometimes critical moments.</p>

<p>They were pleasant lads, both of them, and
by name, Todd and Downey.</p>

<p>Now Ruth turned to them eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>“What was that you said about Bloomberg?”
she asked, doing her best to make the tone of the
question sound casual. “I couldn’t help overhearing——”</p>

<p>The taller of the two lads, Todd, smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>“I was just saying that it would be a good joke
if we were to run into Bloomberg in Alaska,” he
repeated obligingly. “I heard that he had gone
somewhere up the Yukon to run a gambling
place.”</p>

<p>“Just about the sort of thing you might expect
Bloomberg to do,” said Tom, with a grimace of
distaste.</p>

<p>“He was a gambler, you know, before he
turned to the motion picture game,” said Todd.
“I suppose now that he is down and out in his
chosen profession, he’s gone back to his old
trade.”</p>

<p>“Probably hopes to make a lot of money quick
and retrieve his fortunes,” hazarded Tom.</p>

<p>“H’m!” said Ruth absently. “I hadn’t heard!”
She thereupon fell into a deep study from which
Tom found it impossible to arouse her for some
time.</p>

<p>Bloomberg in Alaska running a gambling place!
That was why Charlie Reid had been in New
York to spy upon her and not Bloomberg himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span></p>

<p>Again the old questions came to torment her.</p>

<p>Had that been Charlie Reid she and Helen had
seen on the station platform? Was that Reid in
the lobby of the Tevor-Grand Hotel?</p>

<p>If so, then there was the probability that the
stealthy trailer would not leave them there. The
chances were—and at the thought Ruth looked
about her at the chattering excited crowds uneasily—he
might be aboard that very ship, hidden
somewhere in this sea of people!</p>

<p>The thought that Charlie Reid might even at
that minute be spying upon her was so distasteful
to Ruth that she made some excuse to Tom
and hurried below to the cabin that she was to
share with Helen.</p>

<p>It was a comfortable stateroom, for the steamer
was a large one and boasted every modern convenience
and comfort, but at the moment it
seemed like a prison to Ruth.</p>

<p>She managed to shake off the unpleasant
thought and replied to Helen’s cheery greeting in
kind.</p>

<p>That young person had kicked off her shoes
and was luxuriously reclining on the bed reading
a book she had purchased in Seattle. Beside her
on a chair within easy reach of her groping fingers
was a two-pound box of chocolates.</p>

<p>For just a moment Ruth thought that it would
be nice to be like Helen, relieved of all responsibilities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
and free to enjoy herself to her heart’s
content.</p>

<p>But even while she thought it Ruth knew that
responsibility, excitement, and the thrill of outwitting
an enemy and overcoming obstacles had
become the breath of life to her and that she
could never again be completely content without
them.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ruth, you bold, bad adventurer,”
Helen greeted her flippantly. “Come here and
share my couch and candy and tell me how the
world goes with you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll share the candy but not the couch,” Ruth
laughed. “I have work to do.”</p>

<p>“That is the chief—I might say, only—trouble
with you, Ruth Fielding,” complained her chum.
“You always have so much work to do that you
make me feel like the proverbial sluggard.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just what you are,” said Ruth
indulgently. “But I wouldn’t have you change
for the world. Why, it rests me just to look at
you!”</p>

<p>“That,” said Helen plaintively, “has all the
earmarks of a dirty dig. But I forgive you,
Ruthie—I am far too comfortable even to resent
an insult!”</p>

<p>Ruth laughed and took out the picture Maurice
Brandt had submitted to her, showing enlarged
pictures of the interior scene shot at Hollywood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>But try as she would, she could not keep her
mind upon them. Her thoughts returned again
and again to the information she had gleaned
from Todd.</p>

<p>Bloomberg in Alaska! Bloomberg in Alaska!
beat a monotonous refrain over and over in her
head.</p>

<p>“And fifteen nice long days to think about it!”</p>

<p>She did not realize that she had spoken aloud
until she found Helen staring at her in amazement.</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake—to think about what?”
inquired that flippant young lady. “Wake up,
Ruthie, you’ve been talking in your sleep.”</p>

<p>Of course, after that there was nothing to do
but for Ruth to pass the news about Bloomberg
along to her friend.</p>

<p>“Well,” observed Helen, settling back comfortably
to her story, “I wouldn’t worry about it,
if I were you. Alaska’s a large place and we
may not meet Bloomberg after all.”</p>

<p>If Ruth had her doubts about this she very
firmly kept them to herself. And as she saw nothing
of Charlie Reid and no one mentioned Bloomberg’s
name again, the days on shipboard gradually
settled into a pleasant, steady routine that
temporarily lulled her fears to rest.</p>

<p>Every one seemed to be enjoying himself, and
since there was to be no picture making until they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
reached shore, there was little chance for friction
between directors and actors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ruth Fielding became better
acquainted with the actors and came to feel that
she was making some headway with them.</p>

<p>They were more friendly than they had been at
first and no longer gathered in groups for the
purpose, she could not help feeling, of discussing
her.</p>

<p>So it happened that the fifteen days of journey
to St. Michael which Ruth had looked upon
as a tiresome, if necessary, delay to picture making,
was not so unprofitable after all. The only
two in the company who were not completely won
by their new director’s frank and friendly manner
were Gerard Bolton, the assistant director,
and the humpback, Rumph.</p>

<p>The former maintained his “have to be
shown” attitude while Rumph was openly sullen
and unfriendly.</p>

<p>In spite of this, Ruth was very much encouraged.
With most of the company squarely
back of her and Gerard Bolton not openly unfriendly,
she could afford to snap her fingers at
Joe Rumph. Or so she thought. But events were
soon to prove that Ruth did not know Joe
Rumph’s type as well as she thought she did!</p>

<p>The trip was uneventful up to the fifth day,
which was the day of the big storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>The wind rose about dinner time and by nine
o’clock had lashed itself to such a frenzy that
the passengers left the spray-soaked decks almost
in a body and sought the shelter of their cabins
and their staterooms.</p>

<p>Even below decks the slapping of the waves
against the vessel came to the passengers with an
ominous, rumbling, roaring sound.</p>

<p>The wind increased in violence and the rain fell
in great, blinding gusts that beat upon the decks
with the violence of hailstones.</p>

<p>“Phew!” cried Helen, peeping out of a porthole,
“where do you suppose all that wind comes
from?”</p>

<p>No one answered, for at that moment there
came a rending, grinding noise and the great vessel
listed sharply to one side. At the same moment
came a stentorian cry from above decks, the
most heart-rending cry that can be heard aboard
ship!</p>

<p>“Man overboard!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br>
<span class="fs80">MAN OVERBOARD</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a moment there was pandemonium on the
ship. No one seemed to know exactly what had
happened, and shouts and cries rent the air as
people blocked the stairs and companionways in
a mad scramble for the deck.</p>

<p>Helen and Ruth were among the first to reach
the deck, with Chess and Tom close behind them.
There they were jostled by a seething mass of
humanity and swept on toward the railing.</p>

<p>At the cry of “Man overboard” power had
been shut off in the engine room. Fortunately the
ship had been proceeding cautiously because of
the storm, so that momentum carried it only a
short distance from the scene of the accident.</p>

<p>Several lifeboats were lowered and rushed to
the spot where life savers had already been
thrown to the victim.</p>

<p>A small object was seen bobbing up and down
on the water for several seconds and then disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, he will drown before they reach him!”
cried Helen, putting a hand over her eyes.</p>

<p>“No,” cried Ruth, gripping the rail till the
knuckles of both hands showed white, “there he
is again! See? One of the life preservers has
reached him. He can hold on now.”</p>

<p>“The boats are making good time,” said Tom,
behind her. “He’s as good as rescued now.”</p>

<p>“Wonder who it is,” said Chess, and an obliging
pleasant-faced man behind him volunteered
the information:</p>

<p>“Old chap named Knowles. He was standing
near the rail when we grazed the shoal——”</p>

<p>“Oh, so that’s what we heard below decks!”
cried Helen.</p>

<p>“Yes’m,” said the stranger. “There was a
grinding shock, if you remember, and this old boy
was jarred loose from his hold on the rail and
went overboard.”</p>

<p>The passengers watched with interest while the
first lifeboat reached the elderly victim and lifted
him aboard. The men in the other boats, seeing
that the work of rescue had already been accomplished,
turned back toward the steamer.</p>

<p>“Poor old fellow,” said Ruth commiseratingly.
“The shock and the exposure are enough to kill
an elderly man. I wonder,” she added thoughtfully,
“if I couldn’t get him to take some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
tonic I have in my medicine kit. It might ward
off a serious illness.”</p>

<p>Tom grinned.</p>

<p>“There’s the Red Cross nurse on the job
again,” he said.</p>

<p>But Ruth did not smile with the others. She
meant what she said, and when the lifeboat
reached the ship and the victim was lifted to the
deck, Ruth was one of the first at his side.</p>

<p>The ship’s doctor was already at the spot, well-supplied
with restoratives, and when Ruth begged
him to let her help, saying that she had had experience
in nursing with the Red Cross, the physician
smiled indulgently and invited her to the old
gentleman’s cabin below.</p>

<p>Ruth ran for her favorite prescription, ignoring
the good-natured rallying of her friends, and entered
the old gentleman’s cabin just as they had
made him comfortable in his berth.</p>

<p>The doctor examined the label on the bottle
Ruth held out to him and nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>“Haven’t I met you somewhere before?” he
asked, keen eyes narrowed thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The question surprised Ruth. But as she regarded
the kindly, intelligent face of the physician,
memory flashed back to her the vision of an
emergency hospital somewhere back of the firing
line; still figures on narrow cots of pain; soft-footed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
busy nurses; grim-faced, competent surgeons,
tireless in their service to humanity.</p>

<p>“I was with the Red Cross in France,” she
suggested.</p>

<p>“Of course!” exclaimed the doctor. His manner
was immediately cordial and he spoke as one
member of the profession to another. “I have a
fine memory for faces; but as to names—” He
waved a deprecating hand. “Mr. Knowles is
lucky in having so capable and willing a volunteer
nurse,” he finished pleasantly.</p>

<p>At the mention of his name, the old gentleman
on the bed opened his eyes wearily. His gaze
rested on Ruth and an expression of pleasure
overspread his face.</p>

<p>“This is Miss Fielding, isn’t it?” he asked, as
Ruth came toward him hesitantly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, surprised. “How did you
know?”</p>

<p>The old gentleman smiled.</p>

<p>“Your fame has probably traveled faster than
you think, my dear,” he said kindly. “A good
many people are interested in the work you are
doing.”</p>

<p>So it happened that Ruth stayed longer than
she had intended with Mr. Knowles and visited
the cabin oftener. The more they talked the
more subjects of mutual interest they seemed to
discover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>The indulgent doctor, seeing what a beneficial
effect the girl’s presence was having upon his
elderly patient, encouraged Ruth to visit him
often and stay on and chat with him.</p>

<p>So started the friendship between Ruth and
the lonely old man, a friendship that was destined
to last throughout that long trip to St. Michael
and for some time after, as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Knowles had received no serious injury
from his fall overboard. The shock of the fall
and the consequent exposure had to a large extent
been counteracted by the prompt medical attention
of the ship’s doctor and by Ruth’s careful nursing,
so that in a day or two he was able to be on deck
much the same as usual.</p>

<p>It was not until Ruth’s friendship with the old
gentleman was some four days old that she
learned the history of the Chase girls.</p>

<p>The story must have been very close to the
old gentleman’s heart, for Ruth had several times
sensed that he was on the point of making her his
confidante.</p>

<p>On this particular occasion they were both
chatting idly and pleasantly about some trivial
amusing incidents that had happened aboard ship
when the old gentleman turned to her suddenly
and said:</p>

<p>“Miss Fielding, I am a lonely old man and I
was wondering if you would mind my telling you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
something that has worried me greatly for some
time past.”</p>

<p>Ruth felt surprised but professed her genuine
interest in anything he might have to say to her.</p>

<p>“Thank you, my dear,” he said gratefully, and
for a moment his eyes sought the hazy horizon
where it merged with the gray of the sea.</p>

<p>“If you were not going fairly into their territory,
I might not tell you this,” he said at last.
“But since you are going there and because, being
a girl, I feel that you may be interested in the
troubles of two other girls nearly your own age,
I would like to tell you about Mary and Ellen.”</p>

<p>“Mary and Ellen,” Ruth repeated softly.
“How pretty they sound when you put them together,
like the names in a story book.”</p>

<p>“Their adventures would read like a story,
too.” The old man nodded, his face grave.
“Only in real life these adventures are not so
pleasant.</p>

<p>“These two girls,” he went on after a short
pause, “are the daughters of a very dear friend
of mine. His name was Maurice Chase. As
young men together, he and my son were practically
inseparable, and later—later Maurice took
the place of a son to me.</p>

<p>“It was only when his health failed and he was
threatened with tuberculosis that he thought of
going to Alaska, not only for his health’s sake<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
but with some wild scheme for making his fortune
in the gold fields.”</p>

<p>“Lots of people have done that before him,”
said Ruth.</p>

<p>“Yes; but not middle-aged men with two nearly
grown daughters to support, and with lung trouble
to combat, too. It was an unequal fight, so unequal
that death conquered after only two years
of experiment in the gold fields.”</p>

<p>“Oh, and so your friend is dead!” said Ruth,
in a hushed voice. “And the girls—how about
them?”</p>

<p>“It was about them that Maurice wrote me just
before his death,” replied Mr. Knowles. It was
plain from the emotion in his voice that he and
Maurice Chase had been very good friends indeed.
“He had located a mine, he said——”</p>

<p>“Gold?” interrupted Ruth eagerly, leaning forward
in her steamer chair.</p>

<p>“He thought there was gold,” said the old man
soberly. “And that one thought helped him,” his
voice trailed off almost to a whisper, “to die
happy!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br>
<span class="fs80">KNOCKOUT INN</span></h2>
</div>

<p>“Wasn’t there gold in Mr. Chase’s mine after
all?” asked Ruth eagerly.</p>

<p>Mr. Knowles looked troubled and rubbed a
blue-veined hand across his forehead.</p>

<p>“That’s what I don’t know and what I have
come all this way to find out,” he confessed.</p>

<p>He relapsed into one of his thoughtful pauses,
and eager as Ruth was to hear the rest of this
remarkable story she did not hurry him. She
knew that eventually he would tell her everything,
for he was even more eager to disclose
the facts than she was to hear them.</p>

<p>“Mary herself wrote to me,” he said, after a
moment. “She wrote to tell me of her father’s
death and the fact that she and her sister Ellen
were in desperate trouble.”</p>

<p>“How old are they?” Ruth interrupted long
enough to ask.</p>

<p>“Mary has just come of age,” returned the
old gentleman. “She seems to be a sturdy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
courageous young person, however, and from her
letter to me it appears she is following in the footsteps
of her father, and with her younger sister
Ellen and with the help of three miners who were
friends of her father, is trying to operate the
mine herself.”</p>

<p>“Are the girls all alone—are they living
alone?” asked Ruth breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Yes. But that it not the worst of it,” said
Mr. Knowles. He sat up straight and his thin
face flushed with indignation. “These two plucky
children—for they are hardly more—have enemies,
wicked conniving enemies, who are plotting
to get the mining claim away from them.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” Ruth’s eyes were bright. “Then that
at least seems to show one thing!”</p>

<p>“What?” asked the old gentleman, in a puzzled
way.</p>

<p>“That there is real gold on the claim. Otherwise
these enemies, whoever they are, would not
be so anxious to get hold of it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have thought of that,” said Mr.
Knowles, and he had never looked so pathetically
helpless as at the moment when he made that admission.
“But even though there is gold in the
mine, that will do the girls little good if their
enemies succeed in taking it away from them before
I get there.</p>

<p>“And after all,” he added, with a pitiful shrug<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
of his shoulders, “what can an old man like me
do against such villains as these probably are? I
know nothing of mines or of the laws of the
Yukon country. A sorry protector the girls will
find in me, I fear, even when I have reached
them.”</p>

<p>Though Ruth tried to encourage the old gentleman
and reassure him as well as she could, in her
heart she was convinced that he had spoken very
near the truth. An unworldly, gentle, dreaming
old man, no matter how kind-hearted and desirous
of serving, could probably avail little against the
cold-blooded, hardened type of pioneer buccaneer
who would deliberately attempt to wrest a lawful
claim from two orphaned and defenseless girls.</p>

<p>What Mary and Ellen Chase undoubtedly
needed was a young and virile defender, preferably
one acquainted with the ways of the gold
country and so would be best qualified to cope with
the kind of pirates these poor young things were
facing.</p>

<p>Mr. Knowles did not again refer to the story
during the trip. Ruth told the sad story to Helen,
who expressed the hope that they would run into
the unfortunate girls during their own adventures
and perhaps be able to do something to help
them.</p>

<p>Then came the day when the travelers could
actually look forward to landing within a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
hours at St. Michael. At that disturbing center
they were to take a smaller steamer for points
up the Yukon.</p>

<p>Their ultimate destination was Knockout
Point, a little settlement not far from Dawson
City. This was the spot Ruth had chosen for
the filming of the greater part of the picture. It
would form, she thought, a splendid setting full
of local color for the main outdoor scenes of
“The Girl of Gold.” If she found it necessary
later to take steamer for the filming of some
scenes farther up the river, that all could be arranged
for in due time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Knockout Point was their appointed
destination.</p>

<p>Good connections were made at St. Michael.
The small steamer on which Tom had taken passage
for his party was almost ready to leave as
the great liner docked.</p>

<p>Their quarters aboard the smaller ship were
not as commodious as those they had enjoyed
aboard the liner. But once aboard, no one cared
particularly, since the longest part of the journey
was now over and their destination almost in
sight.</p>

<p>The one thing Ruth regretted was that, in the
excitement of landing, she had lost sight of her
elderly friend, Mr. Knowles. She thought of him
constantly during the rest of the trip and wondered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
what his ultimate destination really was.</p>

<p>Then, a few days later, came the great moment
when they all gathered on deck to watch the approach
to Knockout Point. As the steamer plied
steadily up the broad river, the excitement of
players, cameramen, and directors grew.</p>

<p>It seemed as though Ruth was everywhere at
once, exhorting cameramen to make sure that
precious films and cameras reached shore safely,
seeing that every one had packed and was ready
for the landing.</p>

<p>Knockout Point was a straggling settlement,
extending along the bank of the broad Yukon for
a quarter of a mile or more. It had several docks,
one about ready to fall apart, and a dusty, straggling
main street of one and two story buildings.
It had, in years gone by, gained its name from a
fierce fight between a gold hunter and a desperado
of that vicinity, in which the desperado had gotten
the worst of the combat.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look much like New York, does it?”
remarked Chess.</p>

<p>“New York!” cried Helen. “Why, it can’t
compare with—with Cheslow!”</p>

<p>“Some pretty high mountains in the background,”
went on the young man.</p>

<p>“Yes, and they look grand, don’t they? I suppose
we’ll do some mountain climbing while we
are here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>Ruth thought of and wondered about Mary and
Ellen Chase. She wished she had asked Mr.
Knowles more about them. The old gentleman
had not said in just what part of Alaska their
mine was located, except that it was near Snow
Mountain.</p>

<p>However, he had known that her destination
was Knockout Point and had mentioned the possibility
of her meeting with these unfortunate girls.
Was Snow Mountain and the property of Mary
and Ellen Chase, then, somewhere in the neighborhood
of Knockout Point?</p>

<p>Unable to answer the question to her satisfaction,
Ruth was sorry that she had not found more
time to spend with the old gentleman during the
last days of the trip. He had seemed so lonesome
and bewildered and troubled! If only she
had found out definitely the location of the Chase
mine, she or Tom or some of the rest of them
might have found a way to help the girls and the
old gentleman at the same time.</p>

<p>Well, it was too late now! They had reached
the dock and from that time on other and more
important duties claimed her attention.</p>

<p>Tom was bargaining with an evil-looking person,
whose huge mustache and overhanging eyebrows
seemed to Helen to proclaim him a desperado
of the worst sort, an opinion she confided
in an undertone to Ruth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>The name of this dangerous-looking individual
was Sandy Banks, and the girls were later to learn
that the only fierce part of Sandy was his appearance.
In reality he was the simplest and gentlest
of men, always ready to do a service for his fellow
men, and an ardent admirer and champion
of all women.</p>

<p>When Tom presented him to Ruth and Helen,
this gallant cavalier bent low over the hand of
each of them, his mustache sweeping upward in
a grand and impressive manner.</p>

<p>Helen suppressed a giggle. But Ruth only
smiled, for she had seen the simple friendliness in
the eyes of this great hulking fellow and knew at
once just what type of man he was.</p>

<p>Besides, her mind was working busily along
professional lines. This Sandy Banks would contribute
excellent local color to her picture if he
could be persuaded to act for a day or two as an
extra. Ruth stowed this thought away in a corner
of her brain to be brought forward again when
the time was ripe.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sandy readily agreed to transport
the motion picture company and its paraphernalia
to Knockout Inn, where Tom had already telegraphed
ahead for reservations.</p>

<p>“You purty nigh scairt Slick Jones into his
grave,” said their new acquaintance, with a deep-chested
chuckle. “You come near fillin’ up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
hull place—which ain’t worryin’ Slick none, since
he leaves nigh onto every cent he kin scrape together
down to The Big Chance. Well, sir,
where do you want them things stowed?”</p>

<p>Tom gave instructions in regard to the trunks
and other luggage, but the cameramen decided to
carry their precious cameras with them.</p>

<p>“So far from home it ain’t any use taking
chances with them, Miss Fielding,” said Schultz,
with a grin.</p>

<p>Finding that Knockout Inn was not far from
the river front, they all determined to walk, leaving
only the luggage to Sandy Banks’ rattling old
wagon and dispirited horse.</p>

<p>So they filed along behind this equipage, keeping
at a safe distance from the dust flung up by
its wheels, quite willing that Sandy should take
the lead and that he should proceed as slowly as
possible. It was glorious to be on land again
after the long ship journey, and every one was
in high spirits. Every one, that is, except the
dwarf who brought up the rear in a sort of sulky
isolation, seeming like a dark blot upon the gayety
of the party.</p>

<p>They found Knockout Inn a typical settlement
building, a long low, one-story structure with more
sheds and outhouses than there was building itself.</p>

<p>The proprietor came out to meet them in person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
as Sandy drew his horse to a standstill before
the door. The motion picture company
straggled up, feeling, and perhaps looking, like a
band of gypsies on the trail.</p>

<p>There was a smile on the habitually doleful
countenance of Slick Jones and his hair, black and
sleek, brushed straight back from a rather low
and bulging forehead, shone with unusual brilliance.
Slick was famous among his neighbors for
this style of hair dressing, for no matter how
careless the rest of his attire might be, Slick’s hair
was always sleek and polished like a piece of
patent leather.</p>

<p>“Glad to meet you!” he said now, with a manner
that was evidently intended to match his hair.
“My place ain’t much on looks, but I’m aimin’ to
make it comfortable. Sandy, there! Step lively,
my lad. This way, ladies and gents! This way!”</p>

<p>Once within the big bare room assigned to her
and Ruth, Helen gave vent to joyful giggles.</p>

<p>“Ruth, this is too rich,” Helen gurgled. “It’s
better than any circus I was ever at. Within half
an hour of landing we meet both a desperado and
a confidence man.”</p>

<p>“Only Sandy Banks isn’t a desperado,” said
Ruth, reaching eagerly for a pitcher of cold water.
“And unless I’m very much mistaken, our friend
Slick Jones is far from being a confidence man.”</p>

<p>“Ruth, how can you be so trusting!” Helen
removed her hat and coat and rather gingerly
hung them on a row of rusty hooks along the
wall that seemed to be all the closet the room
contained. “Didn’t you hear Sandy say that
Slick gambled? And then, look at his name, Slick
Jones!”</p>

<p>“From his hair,” said Ruth, sputtering as she
dashed cold water all over her face and neck.
“My, this feels good! Better try some, Helen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>“Come on in, the water’s fine,” sang that young
lady, as she tossed a glove toward the dresser and
missed. “I’ll do that thing in just a minute,
Ruthie. But first I must roam about this palatial
room so that I may fully appreciate all its beauties
and conveniences.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re making fun,” laughed Ruth, as
she scrubbed her cheeks to a healthy red glow.
“You mustn’t expect all the conveniences and luxuries
of home at Knockout Point.”</p>

<p>“One oughtn’t to expect much at Knockout
Point,” said Helen, with a chuckle. “Sounds kind
of ominous, doesn’t it, Ruthie? Knockout Inn at
Knockout Point! Lucky if we get off without a
knockout blow as well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re horrid!” Ruth reproached her.
“If anybody gets a knockout blow it will be
Knockout Point. I can tell you that!”</p>

<p>“All right, Ruthie, if you say so,” said Helen,
throwing a kiss toward her chum. “I’ve come to
believe that sometimes, most generally, you mean
just what you say!”</p>

<p>When they were rested and refreshed the two
girls decided to go on a short tour of exploration.
They had promised to meet Chess and Tom
outside the inn, but they were consumed with a
great curiosity to see the interior of this unusual
place first.</p>

<p>The house followed the very simplest style of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
architecture within as without. There was one
long hall running the full length of the building,
with rooms opening off both sides of it.</p>

<p>On one side were the sleeping apartments, on
the other, the living quarters. These the girls
sauntered through and found them, with the exception
of the large living room, as bare and as
guiltless of ornament as the sleeping rooms.</p>

<p>There was a big dining room with two long
rough-hewn tables, stretching from end to end of
it. With the exception of the tables and chairs
the room held no furniture save a huge, old-fashioned
sideboard that must have been a hundred
years old.</p>

<p>“Wonder how that got here,” said Helen,
pointing to this last curiosity. “I bet that thing
is worth real money.”</p>

<p>“Not to me,” laughed Ruth. “I never saw anything
half so ugly. But look, Helen,” she opened
the door to another room. “This isn’t bad!”</p>

<p>They had entered the living room, the one
apartment that presented any sort of homelike
appearance. One end of the room was practically
taken up by an immense fireplace. Some
big, comfortable chairs were scattered about and
in them were cushions that, while faded and worn,
were immaculately clean.</p>

<p>There was a long table in the center of the
room on which were lying some old periodicals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
and magazines that looked as faded and worn as
the cushions in the chairs.</p>

<p>Some animal skins hung on the walls, effectually
mitigating the bareness of the rafters, and rag
rugs were flung over the rough, unvarnished
floors. An oil lamp completed the furnishings.</p>

<p>As the girls advanced further into the room
some one rose from the shadowy far corner of it
and looked curiously at them. The newcomers
were rather startled at the apparition since they
had supposed the room to be empty and were
glad when the stranger crossed to the hall and
disappeared.</p>

<p>“One of our fellow guests at Knockout Inn,”
laughed Helen, as she and Ruth, arms about each
other, sauntered out to the front of the house
where they were to meet Tom and Chess.</p>

<p>There was not much to be done for the rest of
that day except to wander about and become better
acquainted with the immediate environs of
their headquarters. On the morrow Ruth planned
to start bright and early in search of locations.</p>

<p>There was nothing remarkable about Knockout
Point. A half-abandoned settlement on the river
front, with a few shabby stores, a few scattered
houses hardly worthy of the name, an inn, namely
Knockout Inn, and, set some distance back from
its more respectable neighbors, a dance hall and
gambling den called The Big Chance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>Naturally the girls and their escorts did not explore
this latter place of amusement very thoroughly,
although Ruth did think that on some
future occasion she might be able to use it in her
picture, provided, of course, the management consented.</p>

<p>But even the run-down appearance of the town
in general could do nothing to ruin the scenic
grandeur of the mountains in the background.</p>

<p>Snow Mountain, capped with ice all the year
round and raising its proud crest high above its
fellows, inspired the young people with awe. The
crude and ramshackle buildings of Knockout Point
seemed to them utterly out of place there, huddled
at the base of the mountain and profaning
the grandeur of the background.</p>

<p>“A wonderful spot for making pictures,
Helen,” Ruth murmured finally. “I can scarcely
wait until to-morrow!”</p>

<p>They returned about dinner time to Knockout
Inn to find an ample, if very simple, meal awaiting
them.</p>

<p>There in the big bare dining room the moving
picture company met for the first time since landing.
In response to Ruth’s questions it appeared
that they were well satisfied with their new quarters
(all save Joe Rumph, who merely glowered
and said nothing) and that they were eager to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
start the work of rehearsing as soon as their
youthful director gave the word.</p>

<p>But in spite of their friendly attitude toward
her, Ruth had again the uneasy sense that she
was on probation, that before she was whole-heartedly
accepted by them she must prove her
ability to film a picture such as “The Girl of
Gold.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show them!” thought Ruth valiantly.
“To-morrow I will begin to prove to them exactly
what I can do!”</p>

<p>With this determination well fixed in her mind,
Ruth resisted all efforts on the part of Tom and
the others to persuade her to take an after-dinner
stroll with them.</p>

<p>“I must go up and look over the script and the
book again, so as to have the story well in mind
when I start to hunt locations in the morning,”
she told them. “From now on,” she added, with
a smile, “something tells me I am going to be a
very busy girl!”</p>

<p>“You are always that, Ruth Fielding!” sighed
Helen. “Well, come on, boys; no use trying to
change her mind!”</p>

<p>In the morning Ruth went out bright and early,
getting up before any one else and leaving a note
of explanation for Helen.</p>

<p>Slick Jones, who, as was the case with Sandy
Banks of the monstrous mustache, already felt a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
boundless admiration for the youthful director,
saw that she was served with a good breakfast,
early as the hour was.</p>

<p>Ruth started off buoyantly on foot, convinced
that the location for the taking of the first big
outdoor scene ought to be found somewhere in
the vicinity of Knockout Inn.</p>

<p>The first location decided upon, she could then
take more time in exploring for others. Tom
could do some of the scouting about for her and,
knowing just what it was she wanted, could find
locations that he thought would appeal to her.</p>

<p>The start would have been made. And as
Ruth, in company with all other directors, knew,
the start was almost as important as the finish.
The first scene shot, the action continued on its
own momentum.</p>

<p>Ruth raised her eyes to the white-capped peak
of Snow Mountain lifting above the little settlement
of Knockout Point, and on impulse Ruth
set her feet toward it.</p>

<p>It was the pride of the natives, or so she had
been informed by Sandy Banks the evening before.
They even had a superstition about it.
Snow Mountain guarded and protected all in its
vicinity, so thought the simpler people of the
Yukon. The nearer one lived to it, the more one
could count upon good fortune!</p>

<p>“So the nearer I come to it,” thought Ruth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
whimsically, “the more certain I shall be of finding
a good location!”</p>

<p>But to get nearer to the mountain was no easy
task, as Ruth soon learned. In that rare atmosphere
distances were deceptive, and the young
motion picture director had to travel for an hour
or more before she reached even the base of the
mountain.</p>

<p>It was a hard, hot walk and she rested on a
rock at the foot of the mountain before she started
to climb the first of its several heights.</p>

<p>“My, I wish I had come on horseback,” she
sighed. “I’m footsore already. And then to
think, I’ve got to walk all that way back!”</p>

<p>She had scarcely spoken the words when a
mysterious and horrible thing happened. The
solid ground beneath her feet seemed suddenly to
give way and she felt herself sinking, sinking, into
a bottomless abyss.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<span class="fs80">TRAPPED</span></h2>
</div>

<p>That the abyss into which she had fallen was
not bottomless at all, Ruth found out to her sorrow
when she came down with a thump upon
something that was extremely solid and very hard.</p>

<p>For a moment she was dazed and half stunned
by the fall and sat where she had fallen, groping
in bewilderment for some explanation of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>She had stumbled into some brushwood that
must have pretty effectually hidden a hole of
some sort. A bear trap, possibly. She had heard
that they set traps of this sort for Bruin, covering
a hole in the ground with a clever camouflage
of twigs and leaves.</p>

<p>However, they would hardly set traps so near
the settlement. Bears did not venture this close
to humanity as a rule.</p>

<p>Ruth shook herself impatiently. What did it
matter how this awful thing had happened? The
important thing was that it had and that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
now faced with the necessity of getting herself
out of the predicament as well as she could.</p>

<p>Very cautiously Ruth got to her feet. Groping
with her fingers along the dirt walls of the
hole into which she had fallen, she moved forward
a step or two.</p>

<p>It was fearfully dark down there, and suddenly
Ruth was conscious of a chilling terror.</p>

<p>Suppose this dark hole was the entrance to
the cave of some animal? Suppose her fingers,
groping in the darkness, were to touch, not the
earth sides of the hole, but the fur or cold snout
of some creature of the wild!</p>

<p>“Come, come, this will never do!” she said
aloud, and gained some measure of assurance
from the sound of her own voice. “There must
be a way out of this. Perhaps I can get up again
the way I came in!”</p>

<p>She looked up and saw far above her head a
dim glimmer of light. Again that chill of horror
shook her.</p>

<p>Impossible to scale the sheer sides of the hole
without the aid of a rope in the hands of some
one above.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom, Tom, if I had only done what you
begged me to and not started out alone in this
country that is so strange to me! Oh, what shall
I do? What can I do?”</p>

<p>With a great effort Ruth managed to control<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
her rising panic. In an emergency like this it
would never do to lose her head. And, really, she
had been in much tighter places before.</p>

<p>She forced herself to think slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>It was evident that there was little chance of
getting out of this place the way she had entered
it. Then, too, there was little likelihood that a
rescue party would be sent out after her for hours
to come.</p>

<p>Her very independence and self-sufficiency,
Ruth realized now a bit ruefully, might well prove
her undoing. In her capacity of director she was
accustomed to roaming around for hours alone in
search of locations. So, until several hours had
elapsed, no one would feel any particular alarm
over her absence.</p>

<p>In such circumstances Ruth saw that she must,
if she could, be her own salvation.</p>

<p>She could not go up, but there was a bare
possibility that she might go forward.</p>

<p>“If I only had matches with me,” she muttered
beneath her breath. “As it is, I can’t see
a foot before my face!”</p>

<p>She groped forward again, and after feeling
about cautiously for what seemed to her an endless
time finally felt her hand slip forward into
emptiness.</p>

<p>“A hole!” she thought, with transient triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“Then there is some sort of passage leading from
this place!”</p>

<p>However, it takes the highest form of courage
to go forward, accompanied by pitch darkness,
into an unexplored place. Even Ruth, valiant as
she always was in the face of emergency, hesitated
for a moment before this test of courage.
Then——</p>


<p>“Carry on, Ruth,” she said. “Better any
known thing than this uncertainty!”</p>

<p>She did not really mean that. The cautious
half of her begged that she stay where she was,
for hours, if necessary, until the inevitable rescue
party came to her aid, rather than venture into
that black hole of mystery into which her hand
had slid. But—would they be able to pick up her
trail?</p>

<p>“I don’t even know that I can get all of myself
into that hole,” she murmured, turning her
thoughts resolutely to the present situation. She
forced herself forward again and found that the
aperture was large enough to admit her if she
entered in a stooping posture.</p>

<p>There was one more moment of indecision.
Then, like a swimmer prepared to plunge head-first
into icy water, she gave a little gasp and
entered the opening.</p>

<p>It was so narrow that her body grazed both
sides of it as she groped slowly and painfully forward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
She was now in complete darkness. The
air was heavy and devitalized, and Ruth found
herself breathing with difficulty.</p>

<p>Ahead of her there came a faint and ominous
sound—the staccato drop of pebbles on the earth
floor of the tunnel.</p>

<p>That sound caught at Ruth’s breath and for a
moment she pressed a hand hard against her
wildly beating heart.</p>

<p>Who knew at what moment the tunnel might
cave in, burying her beneath a smothering weight
of dirt and rock? Ruth knew that this was an
actual and imminent peril.</p>

<p>She tried to turn with some vague idea in her
mind of returning to the comparative safety of
the place she had left.</p>

<p>But the movement of her shoulders against the
sides of the tunnel brought with it such a terrifying
rattle of stones that Ruth decided to push
on at any cost.</p>

<p>“There must be an outlet somewhere!” she
gasped sobbingly. “There must be! There
must!”</p>

<p>All the time she knew that the chances were
that the tunnel ended in a dead wall of dirt and
rock. Any moment now her hand might touch a
solid surface, showing that she had reached the
farther end of the underground passage.</p>

<p>Still her hand groping ahead of her touched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
nothing and she pushed on, panting, almost
smothered, nearly exhausted.</p>

<p>“What a hideous, nightmare place!” she
sobbed. “How could I have fallen into such a
trap! How could I?”</p>

<p>Still she struggled on, losing all sense of time
or distance, commanding her aching muscles to
move automatically, convinced in a dazed, half-delirious
sort of way, that she would never come
to the end of this maddening tunnel because there
<em>was</em> no end.</p>

<p>“Tom! Helen!” she kept muttering over and
over, staggering, stumbling, falling to her knees
and forcing herself to her feet again to stagger
and stumble on. “I’ll never see you again!
Never! This is the end! I can’t get out! I
can’t, I can’t—I—can’t——”</p>

<p>The words died out in a vague silence of utter
incredulity. She must have gone out of her head.
She must be mad at last.</p>

<p>There, before her, the faintest beckoning glimmer,
was light!</p>

<span class="fs80">A NIGHTMARE JOURNEY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ruth Fielding began to laugh and then to
cry—her throat working convulsively.</p>

<p>She forced her exhausted muscles to action
again, ran, stumbled, fell, and ran again, bruising
arms and knees and shoulders without knowing,
without caring!</p>

<p>“Light! Light!” she cried over and over
again, her voice weird and smothered in that
breathless place. “There is a way out. There
is!”</p>

<p>But the beckoning light was cruelly deceptive.
It seemed so near and yet appeared ever to recede
as Ruth’s eager hands groped toward it.</p>

<p>Several times she gave up the unequal struggle
and sank to the ground, with all the strength gone
from her limbs.</p>

<p>Then up again and on, sometimes crawling on
hands and knees, sometimes struggling to an upright
position and, by an almost superhuman
effort holding to it, staggering onward—upward—always<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
toward that summoning, faint glimmer
of light.</p>

<p>At last, to lie within an arm’s throw of it,
laughing, weeping, hysterical, panting with
exhaustion.</p>

<p>Then crawling, inch by inch, painfully, groping
toward that tiny aperture!</p>

<p>At last, face close to it, the pungent breath of
the woods drawn deep down into aching lungs!</p>

<p>Ruth rested for a while, gathering her depleted
forces for the last great effort, to drag herself up
and through the opening.</p>

<p>Tired fingers groping, Ruth at last managed to
gain a hold on the roots and soft dirt about the
edge of the hole. But her strength was gone.
The fearful knowledge came to her that she could
not, unaided, draw herself out of that dreadful
place. Her fingers were growing numb.</p>

<p>Suddenly the blue of the sky above her was
blotted out. Still clinging to the edge of the hole
with what little strength was left her, Ruth
looked up.</p>

<p>A face was bending over her—the face of a
girl on which was written surprise and horror.</p>

<p>“Oh, help me!” begged Ruth. “I can’t hold
on——”</p>

<p>“Give me your hand,” commanded the girl
briskly. “Hold on with one hand and try to
help yourself while I pull. Here we go!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>There followed a heart-breaking moment of
slipping and pulling when it seemed that they
both must fall into the pit together.</p>

<p>But the strange girl was strong and Ruth was
desperate. One last, hard pull, and Ruth found
herself lying upon a bed of soft moss and sweet-scented
flowers.</p>

<p>She lay for a moment, panting, trying to regain
her strength. Her rescuer bent over her anxiously.</p>

<p>“Do you feel better?” asked the latter. “Can
you—do you think you can walk?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” returned Ruth, and struggled to
her feet. She swayed unsteadily and was amazed
to find how weak she was.</p>

<p>The strange girl put a slender, strong young
arm about her shoulders and spoke with an air
of quiet authority.</p>

<p>“You must come with me—please,” she said.
“Our cabin is only a short distance away. Look—there
it is through the trees. There you can
rest until you are stronger and can tell me just
what has happened.”</p>

<p>Ruth said no more, but allowed her new friend
to lead her down a narrow path that led to a
small cottage. It was the rudest kind of little
dwelling, built, as even Ruth could see, by one
who was an amateur at such work. A lonely
enough place, Ruth thought, to house such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
pretty young creature as this girl who walked beside
her.</p>

<p>As they neared the house Ruth saw another
figure framed in the doorway.</p>

<p>Her new acquaintance must have followed the
direction of her glance, for she said quickly:</p>

<p>“My sister. We live here together.”</p>

<p>Ruth turned startled eyes upon the girl.</p>

<p>“Not alone?” she cried.</p>

<p>The girl nodded sadly.</p>

<p>“There is no one else since father died,” she
said, and Ruth could see the quick tears spring to
her eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sorry!” Ruth felt as though she had
unwittingly put her finger upon a throbbing
wound.</p>

<p>She was glad that they had reached the house
and so temporarily put an end to conversation.</p>

<p>She found the other sister younger and more
immature than the one who had so luckily
encountered her in the woods. She was a thin
and gangling girl, perhaps sixteen or seventeen
years old, and not, at first sight, so attractive as
her sister. However, the younger sister had a
sweet face, and, Ruth thought, gave promise of
beauty later on.</p>

<p>The sisters led Ruth eagerly into the one main
room of the cabin. Ruth was to learn later that
there was a tiny sleeping apartment partitioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
off from this kitchen, dining room and sitting
room combined.</p>

<p>They seemed pitifully pleased at having a visitor
and hovered over her with such eagerness to
serve that Ruth was quite won by them.</p>

<p>The older girl brought her a drink of refreshingly
cold well water at once, which Ruth drank
gratefully.</p>

<p>Then the sisters coaxed her to let them give her
a cup of tea and perhaps a fried egg and a bit
of bacon. But Ruth protested that she was not
in the least hungry and only needed a short rest
before she would be perfectly fit and able to start
back to her friends.</p>

<p>“If you will show me the way,” she added,
with her bright friendly smile.</p>

<p>“Indeed we will. Although we would like so
much to keep you with us.” The younger of the
two girls said this with a wistful tone and look.
It was pathetic, too, Ruth thought, to see how
the younger of the two girls leaned upon the
strength and courage of the elder.</p>

<p>She was about to ask the sisters as tactfully as
she could how it happened that they were alone
in this remote place when the older girl forestalled
her by asking a question of her own.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind telling me,” she said
gravely, “I’d like to know what happened to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
before I came along and helped you out of that
hole.”</p>

<p>“I fell into another hole!” said Ruth.</p>

<p>The sisters were mystified at that, and so Ruth
explained the harrowing circumstances that preceded
the fortunate discovery of her plight by
this new friend.</p>

<p>The older girl listened with grave interest,
while the younger interrupted often with eager
questions.</p>

<p>The latter would have kept Ruth talking of
her own affairs indefinitely, had not the young
director adroitly switched the conversation to a
subject which had aroused her curiosity.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to appear to pry,” she said, with
her pleasant smile. “But I do feel that I owe a
debt of gratitude to the young lady who helped
me out of a very bad scrape indeed. And how
am I going to express my gratitude,” she added
gayly, “when I don’t even know the young lady’s
name?”</p>

<p>The older girl smiled at this—a slow, grave
smile that seemed characteristic of her.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she said. “We should have told
you before. I am Mary Chase and this is my
sister, Ellen.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br>
<span class="fs80">COINCIDENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>For a minute Ruth sat staring at the girl,
wondering whether she might believe the evidence
of her ears.</p>

<p>“Did you say Mary Chase?” she queried
finally. “Are you sure? Oh, I don’t mean that,
my dear!” she added quickly, as the faces of
both girls expressed surprise and wonderment.
“I was only thinking that my falling into that hole
back yonder might have some purpose after all!”</p>

<p>The girls looked more bewildered than before
and Mary said slowly:</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we quite understand you.”</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t,” replied Ruth, and drew
her chair a little closer to the sisters. “Now
listen, my dears, and I will tell you of an extraordinary
coincidence.”</p>

<p>While they listened in a wondering silence Ruth
told them of her meeting with their father’s
friend, Mr. Knowles, and that he had explained
to her a great deal concerning them, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
their fight with the rascals who were attempting
to get hold of their property.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful—your knowing all about us!”
said Ellen, in her eager, shy voice. “Then that
makes us—” she hesitated, then finished with a
blush at her boldness, “not really strangers after
all.”</p>

<p>“It ought to make us the best of friends,” said
Ruth heartily, and it struck at her warm heart to
see how the two girls brightened at her words.</p>

<p>“Mr. Knowles has been here,” Mary volunteered.</p>

<p>A look of doubt and sadness came into her eyes
as she added:</p>

<p>“He is very good, but I’m afraid he won’t be
able to help us very much. He seemed more bewildered
than we are when we tried to explain to
him. I don’t know—I don’t know,” in a half-whisper,
as though she were speaking to herself,
“what is going to become of us!”</p>

<p>Ruth leaned toward the girl impulsively.</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you could trust me enough
to tell me about it, Mary?” she said. “I don’t
know that I should understand any better than
Mr. Knowles. But I should like to try.”</p>

<p>“You are very good!” said Mary, reaching out
a hand to Ruth.</p>

<p>“Indeed you are!” said Ellen. “It is so long,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
she added softly, “since we have had another
woman to talk to.”</p>

<p>“It is that man Lieberstein who is making all
the trouble,” said Mary, her face flushing with
indignation as she mentioned the name of her
enemy. “He says he located the claim before
Dad did.”</p>

<p>“Which is perfectly silly!” Ellen broke in
swiftly. “He never came here until after Dad
had taken out his papers and started to work the
mine.”</p>

<p>“Have you the papers?” asked Ruth quickly.</p>

<p>Mary looked nervously about her as though
even then she was afraid of being spied upon.</p>

<p>“We have them, yes,” she half-whispered, and
for a moment there stole into her face a look of
grim resolution that made her look many years
older. “And we are going to keep them. One of
us,” with swift glance toward her sister, “is always
awake when the other sleeps. We still have
Dad’s shotgun, you see,” she added swiftly.</p>

<p>“You see we are trying to work the mine ourselves,”
Ellen volunteered. She spoke as casually
as though operating a mine were an ordinary
occupation for young women of sixteen and
twenty-one. “Old Eddie Jones is trying to help
us, and two other miners that used to be friends
of father’s.”</p>

<p>“We would do very well, too,” said Mary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
quickly, and Ruth liked the determined gleam in
her eyes, “if it wasn’t for that old cave-in. We
have to dig down through a lot of dirt and rock
before we can reach gold. It’s pretty slow going,”
she added simply, “if you haven’t the right
kind of equipment.”</p>

<p>Ruth frowned with quick pity. She was silent
for a moment, thinking deeply.</p>

<p>“You are afraid this man, Lieberstein, will get
hold of your father’s papers and then lay claim to
the mine?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes; and he will do it if he can,” returned
Mary. “When we both have to be away from the
cabin we leave one of the old prospectors here to
guard the papers.”</p>

<p>“Just what have you to prove your claim?”
asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“A map of the mine and signed papers proving
that Dad was really the one who staked the
claim,” said Mary. “We keep them all in—”
she paused while the slow color flooded her face.</p>

<p>Ruth never knew how near Mary had come to
revealing the secret to her of the real hiding
place of her dead father’s precious papers. But
Mary suspected Max Lieberstein, and so was
suspicious of every one else. Now, to cover her
confusion, she said, with a grim little smile:</p>

<p>“You see, if we lose the papers we lose everything.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
And that’s why we keep Dad’s shotgun
always handy!”</p>

<p>“Who is this Lieberstein, anyway?” asked
Ruth suddenly. “Where does he come from?”</p>

<p>“Dawson City,” answered Ellen.</p>

<p>“I wish he were back there now!” cried Mary,
speaking with a swift, passionate rush of words.
“I wish I had some way of sending him back so
that he would never, never dare come here again!”</p>

<p>“He is close by, then?” It was more a statement
than a question.</p>

<p>Mary nodded.</p>

<p>“He stays at The Big Chance at Knockout
Point,” she said.</p>

<p>“The Big Chance is run by a new man,” Ellen
contributed, with apparent irrelevance. “His
name is Sol Bloomberg.”</p>

<p>Ruth rose from her chair so swiftly that it
overturned and went clattering on the bare board
floor. She caught Mary by the shoulders and
shook her, scarcely knowing what she did.</p>

<p>“Sol Bloomberg!” she cried. “Proprietor of
The Big Chance! Oh, this is too much! I can’t
believe it!”</p>

</div>

<p>For the second time within an hour the Chase
girls looked alarmed at Ruth’s vehemence. Seeing
their bewilderment, Ruth strove to collect
herself and to dissemble her dismay at this new
and startling bit of information.</p>

<p>Slowly she picked up the overturned chair and
reseated herself. Her hands shook as she clasped
them tight in her lap and her face was white.</p>

<p>“Sol Bloomberg running The Big Chance! I
might have guessed it before. I should have
inquired——”</p>

<p>“But why do you care that Sol Bloomberg is
running The Big Chance?” Mary Chase inquired,
puzzled. “I wish Ellen had not told you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no! It’s all right,” said Ruth hastily,
forcing her stiff lips to smile. “I happen to be
acquainted with Bloomberg, that’s all; and if
this is the same man, I certainly know little good
of him.”</p>

<p>“He is a bad man!” Ellen burst out with almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
childish fury. “I have heard that he cheats at
cards, but he does it so cleverly that nobody can
catch him in the act. He is a bad man, and I
think he wants our claim as much as Lieberstein—and
maybe more!”</p>

<p>“Hush, Ellen! You should not say such things
unless you know,” cautioned Mary, but the
younger sister persisted stubbornly.</p>

<p>“I can’t see any harm in saying what one believes,”
she protested. “Bloomberg is a bad man
and I hate him as much as I do Lieberstein.”</p>

<p>Ruth had been watching the girl with an intent
interest. Now she rose quickly from her chair.</p>

<p>“You may be right, my dear,” she said. “Anyway,
I thank you for what you have told me, and
for what you, Mary, have done for me, and I
will try to help you both as much as I possibly
can.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you are not going so soon?” cried
Ellen. “I thought perhaps you might stay and
keep us company for a little.”</p>

<p>“No, I must go back now!” Ruth spoke quickly,
almost feverishly. With Bloomberg in the neighborhood
she had the instinct to return to her
company as quickly as possible. “I will come to
see you again as often as I can and speak to
friends about you, and you must come and watch
us sometimes at our work.”</p>

<p>“Work!” they cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>“What kind of work do you do?” added Mary.</p>

<p>Ruth saw that she would not be able to get
away without some sort of explanation, so she
wisely compromised.</p>

<p>“Show me to the road and point out my way
back to Knockout Point,” she said, “and I will
explain to you about my work as we go.”</p>

<p>As the road was near and nothing could
possibly happen in the little time they would be
away from the cabin, both the Chase girls
accompanied Ruth.</p>

<p>“Oh, will you let us come and watch you some
time if we can find some one to stay at the cabin
while we are away?” asked Ellen, the words
stumbling over each other in her eagerness, after
the tale was told.</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Ruth, putting her arm about
the younger girl. “As soon as we start to take
the first picture you may sit on the fence—provided
there is one!—and watch to your heart’s
content.”</p>

<p>Ellen sighed with complete happiness at the
prospect, and even Mary’s troubled eyes brightened.</p>

<p>“If I could only act in the moving pictures just
once I think I should die happy,” said Ellen. “I
would even—forgive Lieberstein!”</p>

<p>Ruth laughed at that extravagance, and then
they found that they had reached the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span></p>

<p>The girls were sorry over the prospect of
parting with their new-found friend. But Ruth
was on fire to get back to Knockout Point, to tell
Tom what she had heard about Bloomberg.</p>

<p>“It’s a long way back to the river front,” said
Mary. “It would be a long tramp, even for some
one who is used to walking——”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m that some one—” Ruth was beginning
when Ellen interrupted.</p>

<p>“Look there!” she cried, pointing to a cloud of
dust that appeared in the distance. “Dust means
horsemen. Some one is coming this way——”</p>

<p>“And coming fast!” finished Ruth hopefully.</p>

<p>Horsemen meant the possibility of a lift back
to Knockout Point, or at least the conveying of a
message there to her friends. Ruth was still
weak from her terrible experience in the tunnel
and the prospect of a long walk along an unknown
road had not appealed to her as much as she had
been pleased to pretend.</p>

<p>“If it’s Lieberstein—” Mary was beginning
when an exclamation of sheer joy from Ruth
clipped the sentence short.</p>

<p>Ruth started running down the middle of the
road toward the horsemen at the imminent peril
of being run down by them.</p>

<p>“Tom! Chess!” she shrieked. “Oh, I never
was so glad to see any one in my life!”</p>

<p>Tom and Chess reined in their horses sharply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
and swung to the ground. It was then that Ruth
saw the identity of the third rider.</p>

<p>“Mr. Boardman!” she cried. “It was good of
you to come! I suppose,” looking at Tom’s
white, drawn face, “that this is a sort of rescue
party?”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness it was successful,” said Tom,
and took Ruth’s outstretched hand in a grip that
hurt. “We’ve just about had heart failure!”</p>

<p>“Been standing on our heads for the last two
hours,” Chess corroborated. “Thought you were
gone for good this time, Ruth.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Tom, regarding the
girl closely. “Have you been running into danger
again, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been falling into holes—or rather a
hole!” retorted Ruth, making light of her adventure.
“But by good luck I managed to stumble
out again. I’m all right now, thanks to that same
good luck—and Mary Chase!”</p>

<p>Ruth turned to the two girls. They had retreated
to the side of the road and were looking
on, Mary gravely, Ellen with a shy interest at
this meeting between Ruth and her friends.</p>

<p>Ruth made the introductions in a laughing manner
that helped to put the two girls at their ease,
and before she rode away with Tom and Chess
and Layton Boardman, Ruth made the two sisters
promise that they would get one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
friendly old miners to take charge of the mine
and the cabin long enough for them to run down
once or twice and watch motion pictures in the
making.</p>

<p>As the two girls turned to go Ruth was surprised
and amused to catch a look of admiration
in the eyes of Layton Boardman as they rested
upon the elder of the Chase girls.</p>

<p>She spoke of this to Tom as she rode before
him in the saddle.</p>

<p>“Did you see Layton Boardman look at
Mary?”</p>

<p>“Which was Mary?” asked Tom indifferently.
At the moment he was so glad to get Ruth back
safe that all the Marys in the world held small
interest for him.</p>

<p>“The older girl—the tall one, you know, with
the grave face,” Ruth explained. “Our actor
looked at her as if he really saw her. And since
he is such a woman hater, you must admit that’s
unusual.”</p>

<p>“I admit nothing of the sort,” Tom laughed.
“Even a cat can look at a king!”</p>

<p>“Only this time it happened to be a queen,”
said Ruth, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>She fell silent after that, trying to recall all
that Mary Chase and her sister Ellen had told
her about Max Lieberstein and Sol Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Was it true, as the two girls seemed to think,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
that these rascals were working together to get
the Chase claim for themselves? If so, Ruth
vowed that she would defeat Sol Bloomberg, and
Lieberstein, too.</p>

<p>Busy days followed for Ruth, days of rush
and strain that sometimes found her tired out
and depressed, sometimes jubilant and confident
of the success of her great undertaking.</p>

<p>They found suitable locations in plenty in and
about Knockout Point. In fact, their chief embarrassment
seemed to be in the matter of
selecting the best. It was an embarrassment of
riches.</p>

<p>Setting about her work with her usual vim and
enthusiasm, Ruth gradually won the confidence
of her company. It needed only the filming of
the first big outdoor scene, with Ruth here and
there and everywhere at once, commanding,
directing, coaching, to prove to them her unusual
directing ability.</p>

<p>Even Gerard Bolton, the skeptical, was convinced,
and from that time on became one of
Ruth’s most loyal and enthusiastic supporters.</p>

<p>There were only two flies in Ruth’s ointment
of content. But they were enough to keep her
constantly on the anxious seat.</p>

<p>The first and perhaps the most annoying, was
Sol Bloomberg of The Big Chance, whom she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
had found to be in truth her old enemy and the
author of those threatening letters.</p>

<p>The fact that he had as yet made no move to
hinder her in the work of picture-making reassured
Ruth not at all. She knew Bloomberg
and his talent for disguising his true purpose
until the moment came to strike.</p>

<p>Ruth felt that sooner or later he would aim a
deadly blow at her. She had no defense, since
she could not possibly tell from what angle he
would strike.</p>

<p>The second fly, also an annoying one, was Joe
Rumph, the dwarf.</p>

<p>His original unfriendly feeling toward Ruth
had been fanned into a flame of enmity by her
decision to tone down the part he had to play in
several different scenes of the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond had told her to use her judgment
in all such matters. So when Ruth thought
that the story would be stronger and more interesting
without too much display of the dwarf’s
atrocious ugliness, she said so—always, of course,
in a mild and tactful way.</p>

<p>Then one day on the lot when they were getting
ready to shoot the last of a series of several
scenes, matters came to a climax between Ruth
and the actor.</p>

<p>For some time past Rumph had been “hogging”
some of Boardman’s best scenes, insisting on retaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
the limelight when he should long since
have been a victim to the “fade-out.”</p>

<p>Ruth had spoken to him several times about
this, and the last time her voice was sharp with
annoyance. The scene had been going excellently,
and if Rumph had kept to his place would undoubtedly
have been one of the best in the series.</p>

<p>As it was he bid fair to spoil all her work and
possibly a good many feet of expensive film.</p>

<p>Ruth was more patient and long-suffering than
most directors, who often “go up in the air” at
the slightest provocation. But when Rumph insolently
ignored her instructions again, even her
patience gave way beneath the strain.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rumph,” she said, going close to the actor
and speaking very quietly, “I would like you
to understand that as long as I am director here,
you are to do exactly as I say.”</p>

<p>“And if you are to remain director here,” said
Joe Rumph with calm insolence, “then I don’t
care to act any longer under your direction.”</p>

<p>“Then go!” cried Ruth. “Your resignation is
accepted. If you care to, you may leave to-day.
Mr. Cameron will settle with you,” and Ruth
turned at once to the script she held in her hand.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br>
<span class="fs80">A VICIOUS ENEMY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It is probable that the other actors of Ruth’s
company were as much startled by this ultimatum
as Joe Rumph himself. The dwarf had become
so accustomed to thinking of himself as being
invaluable to Ruth in the making of her
picture that her easy acceptance of his threat
to leave came as an unpleasant surprise to
him.</p>

<p>He stared at Ruth as if doubtful whether or
not to believe his ears. He started to speak,
thought better of it, and with a horrible frown
on his heavy-featured face, turned and stalked off
the “lot.”</p>

<p>Tom, who had been watching the scene with
clenched fists, ready to chastise Rumph if his
manner became too offensive, hurried up to
Ruth.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Tommy-boy,” she said quickly
and so softly that no one else could hear. “I’ve
been just waiting for this chance. I’m so happy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
that he gave me the opportunity. Now you just
watch me!”</p>

<p>She called to Carlton Brewer, the actor who
had played the chum of the hero and who, in
Ruth’s estimation, possessed unusual acting
ability.</p>

<p>With a wave of her hand she summoned Abe
Levy, the make-up man, and the three drew a
little aside from the others, talking eagerly and
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Can you do it?” Ruth asked at last of Levy.
“Can you make him into the kind of cripple who
will arouse a sort of reluctant sympathy from the
audience even in his villainies but that will not
shock their sensibilities by a too-hideous deformity?”</p>

<p>“Can I!” retorted Levy, with all the enthusiasm
of a genuine artist. “You watch me, Miss
Fielding! You just keep your eye on me! If I
don’t turn out the finest hunchback you ever saw
inside of half an hour, then my name ain’t Abe
Levy and I’m here to tell the world about it!”</p>

<p>Carlton Brewer stepped close to Ruth. It was
evident that he was deeply moved and was finding
it difficult to express what he felt.</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you what it means to me, Miss
Fielding,” he said gruffly. “This chance to prove
that I’m something besides a glorified extra. I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
make good if it’s in me—and that’s a promise!”</p>

<p>Ruth’s smile was radiant.</p>

<p>“I know it’s in you!” she cried. “That’s part
of my business—to judge men—and I’ve been
watching you very closely, Mr. Brewer. I’ve an
idea that you know Joe Rumph’s part better than
he knows it himself!”</p>

<p>Brewer grinned, a boyish disarming grin that
made him very attractive.</p>

<p>“Of course <em>I</em> think I could play it much better!”</p>

<p>Ruth’s eyes gleamed and she laughed exuberantly.</p>

<p>“Prove it!” and with a wave of her hand consigned
him to the care of the make-up man.</p>

<p>“Attention, everybody!” she cried, returning
to the scene. “We’ll rehearse that scene again,
leaving out temporarily the part of the villain.
Mr. Boardman, please! Miss Lytelly, you have
just stumbled upon your lover in the clearing.
He is unconscious. You think he is dead. You
are forgetful of your own danger. You forget
everything as you turn his face so that you may
see it! Can you cry? Good! Everybody
ready?”</p>

<p>The scene was enacted not once but several
times, and each time Ruth criticized one point or
another and changed this or that, until she had
it exactly as she desired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>“Now then, do it just like that,” she cried at
last. She looked at the two cameramen who were
doing the shooting. “Ready?” And as they
nodded, she threw up her hand. “Ready? Go!”
And then the cameras clicked and the much-rehearsed
scene was recorded on the strips of film.</p>

<p>At the end Ruth felt a light touch on her arm
and found Edith Lang beside her. Tears were
streaming down the face of the temperamental
actress, but her face was wreathed in smiles.</p>

<p>“Fine! Excellent!” she cried. “It takes a
clever actress to make me weep. But you, my
dear Miss Fielding, you bring out the best that
is in us. You stir the imagination, the emotions,
like skilled fingers on the sensitive strings of a
harp. You are wonderful, wonderful, my dear
Ruth Fielding. I have never worked under a director
just like you.”</p>

<p>Athrill with a fine elation, Ruth turned and
grasped the actress’ hands in both her own.</p>

<p>“And to-morrow comes your own big act!” she
cried. “The most dramatic, the climactic scene of
the play. I am looking forward to that!”</p>

<p>“And I!” said Edith Lang softly.</p>

<p>It was only after the day’s work was done
that Ruth’s mood became a little less exuberant.</p>

<p>She and Tom were walking slowly toward the
inn, both thoughtful and unusually quiet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“That was a bold move of yours,” Tom said
gravely—“sending Joe Rumph away.”</p>

<p>“He resigned,” Ruth countered. Then as Tom
made no remark: “Just the same, I am sure I
did the right thing, Tom.”</p>

<p>“So am I, as far as the filming of the play is
concerned,” Tom replied loyally. “I ought to
know enough to trust your judgment by this time,
Ruth. It isn’t that. I was just thinking that
Joe Rumph might make an unpleasant enemy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tommy,” Ruth was suddenly weary and
plaintive, “haven’t we enough enemies, already?
Please, please, don’t borrow trouble—or a new
enemy!”</p>

<p>Still, had Ruth known that at that very moment
Joe Rumph was in converse with a deadly
enemy of hers she might have thought a little
more concerning Tom’s warning.</p>

<p>There were three of them in the private back
room of The Big Chance—Sol Bloomberg, characteristically
chewing on a great black cigar, a
man named Max Lieberstein and Joe Rumph.</p>

<p>“We ought to be able to pull it off, the three of
us together,” the latter was saying, heavy brows
drawn down over smoldering eyes.</p>

<p>“Yeah! Kill two birds with one stone!”
Bloomberg spoke with relish. “We’ll spoil Ruth
Fielding’s picture for her and oust those Chase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
girls at the same time. Real gold in that mine,
eh, Max?”</p>

<p>Lieberstein grinned evilly.</p>

<p>“So much gold there is there, Sol, you an’ me
ain’t got no call to worry the rest of our lives
yet. Easy, Sol, easy! Like taking candy from a
baby!”</p>

<p>Which was exactly what it was!</p>

<p>Everybody was present to see Edith Lang in
her big scene. Mary and Ellen Chase had left
their cabin with Eddie Jones as guard long enough
to come down and watch the work of picture taking.</p>

<p>There was another little romance in progress,
too, that had nothing to do with the making of
motion pictures, and both Ruth and Helen were
watching it from one side with truly feminine
pleasure and interest.</p>

<p>To-day Helen pressed her chum’s arm as Ruth
was passing and said softly:</p>

<p>“Look over there, Ruth,” pointing to where
Layton Boardman, a handsome and romantic-looking
figure, was talking earnestly to Mary
Chase. There was a look in his eyes that was
plain for all to read. “Our cowboy friend has
fallen head over ears at last!”</p>

<p>Ruth laughed and her eyes softened as she saw
the trusting look in Mary’s pretty, upturned face.</p>

<p>“Layton Boardman will wake up now, if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
never has before,” she said softly. “And, Helen
dear, I am so glad. Poor Mary Chase needs a
protector if ever girl did in this world!”</p>

<p>This was the day of Edith Lang’s big scene,
and all were agog with interest. The company
were all fond of the actress personally, and even
the stars of the play never thought to be jealous
of her ability.</p>

<p>Miss Lang herself was strung up to acting
pitch and feverishly eager for her big moment.</p>

<p>There was some preliminary work to be done
before Miss Lang appeared on the scene, but
having rehearsed this thoroughly the day before,
Ruth gave orders to start work at once.</p>

<p>Everything went beautifully up to the entrance
of Edith Lang.</p>

<p>“Now, Miss Lang!” cried Ruth excitedly.
“You come on the scene just as the villain—Carlton
Brewer in the rôle this time and a perfect
example of the marvelous deception of which
Levy and a cameraman are capable—just as the
villain is in the act of jumping the claim staked
off by your daughter the day before. Because
she is ill, you have come in her place to protect
your property. Panting, exhausted, almost fainting,
you still defy the thief— Right! Fine!— He
starts to run—you get in his way— Good!
Good!— He grapples with you—his fingers are
about your throat— You feel yourself choking—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
Desperate, fainting, your groping fingers rest
upon something hard— Good!— His gun— You
draw it forth— You——”</p>

<p>Her voice trailed off and with incredulity and
anger she stared at the cameramen.</p>

<p>“Go on!” she cried frantically. “Don’t stop
here! Can’t you see you are ruining the film?”</p>

<p>Bert Traymore shook his head despairingly and
his face puckered up as though he were about to
cry.</p>

<p>“No use, Miss Fielding. Some one has been
tampering with the magazines and cut off several
hundred feet of film!”</p>

<p>Ruth experienced a moment of physical sickness.
Edith Lang’s big scene had been ruined, the
morale of her company seriously threatened, and
all for the loss of a few hundred feet of film!</p>

<p>Of course the scene could be shot again, Miss
Lang could undoubtedly work herself up to “acting
pitch” again, but for that day at least no more
could be expected of her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile her company had gathered about
her in consternation. Edith Lang was almost in
tears with vexation and the sudden shift of her
emotions. Bert Traymore was standing staring
at his camera with a bewildered, hang-dog expression
that at any other time would have appealed
to Ruth’s sense of humor. For a cameraman to
come off for a day’s work with an insufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
amount of film in his magazines is an offense that
ordinarily costs him his position. Atwater, who
had been grinding his machine from another
angle, was in a like situation.</p>

<p>In this case Ruth was not inclined to be too
hard on the jovial Traymore and his comrade.
She was not forced to hunt very far or very long
for the origin of this tampering. Bloomberg, with
his allies, had evidently started on the campaign
of obstruction. This, Ruth felt, was only the
first of a long series of annoyances.</p>

<p>She carried off the situation as well as she could.
Traymore and Atwater were let off with a warning
to examine their magazine boxes more carefully
in the future and to be sure hereafter that
they had the required length of film before starting
out on a day’s work.</p>

<p>Of course there was a good deal of gossip
among the actors, but Ruth told them nothing
concerning her suspicions.</p>

<p>With her own intimate friends she was hardly
more communicative. Though Helen and Tom
were wrathful over the episode and Chess sympathetic,
Ruth made scarcely any comment.</p>

<p>“I’ve been expecting something of the sort,”
was all she would say. “From now on I can see
that this thing is going to be a fight between me
and Bloomberg, and I’ve got to conserve my
forces to win.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>After a period of concentrated thought Helen
looked at Ruth oddly.</p>

<p>“Do you know, Ruth Fielding,” she said, “I
have been thinking a lot lately about our old
friend, Charlie Reid.”</p>

<p>Ruth’s glance tacitly requested her to go on.</p>

<p>“I have a feeling that we were right when we
suspected Charlie of following us. Or perhaps
he wasn’t really following us, but was coming out
here to join Bloomberg at The Big Chance. He
probably found out all he wanted to know in
New York about you and your new agreement
with Mr. Hammond.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t even caught a glimpse of him
here,” protested Ruth. “Aren’t you rather jumping
at conclusions, Helen?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” replied Helen, with a shrug of her
shoulders. “But you mark my words, Ruth. I’ll
wager about anything I own that Charlie Reid
will flash into the picture sometime before we
leave Knockout Point for good.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right,” said Ruth, with a
troubled frown. “Bloomberg would almost certainly
stay at a safe distance and make use of a
tool, and Charlie Reid certainly seems to have
the bad-penny habit of always turning up just
when you want him least!”</p>

<p>Ruth worked hard in the days that followed,
and in her haste there was a suggestion of panic.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
Every scene that was shot without the interference
of Bloomberg she counted that much gained.
Every morning when she awoke her heart sank
with the thought that perhaps this was the day
Bloomberg had chosen to strike. For that he
intended to strike she had not the slightest doubt.</p>

<p>Several unexplained accidents occurred, slight
in themselves but serving to annoy and irritate
actors and directors alike and to cause considerable
delay and money loss.</p>

<p>There was the time, for instance, when the
make-up man found his pet jar of yellow grease
paint missing just as he was making up the extras
for a big outdoor scene.</p>

<p>The boy actor, Eben Howe, came to Ruth in a
state of great excitement.</p>

<p>“Say, Miss Fielding, I bet I know who run
off with that grease paint,” he said, his eyes
fairly starting out of his freckled face. “I saw
Joe Rumph sneakin’ around the place just yesterday.
I’d know that crooked back anywhere.
But when I called out to him, just friendly like,
he give me a dirty look and beat it. I bet it was
him,” came with all the gravity of the youthful
detective, “was after that yellow paint!”</p>

<p>“Probably he thought it would improve his
beauty, Eben,” Tom laughed.</p>

<p>But when the boy had gone, Tom and Ruth exchanged
glances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“So Rumph is in this, too,” she said slowly.
“They’re pressing us pretty hard, Tom!”</p>

<p>“Now don’t worry,” Tom tried to reassure her.
“If they don’t do anything worse, we’ll be
lucky.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” said Ruth. “<em>If</em> they don’t!” and Tom
did not miss the emphasis on the “if.”</p>

<p>But despite the worries and setbacks, they came
to a time when all the big exterior scenes had
been shot. At a few of the locations Mary and
Ellen Chase had been present, though it was not
often that they could leave their work at the mine
nor dared to relax their guard of the cabin, even
when they left one of the three miners in charge.</p>

<p>In those days Ruth came upon unexpected proof
that she had not been wrong in her conviction
that Layton Boardman really admired the elder
of the Chase girls.</p>

<p>The actor talked to her whenever he had a
chance, and once Ruth came upon them at an unsuspected
rendezvous in the woods. Mary was
talking earnestly and Boardman was listening
with the greatest attention, watching the girl all
the time with that strange new look in his eyes.</p>

<p>Ruth stole away so quietly that neither one of
them knew they had been observed. Safely out
of earshot, she chuckled softly.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” she said to the empty woods. “It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
looks as if Layton Boardman were beginning to
wake up at last!”</p>

<p>When Ruth was faced with the problem of
where to make her interior cabin scene her mind
went naturally to the Chase cabin.</p>

<p>When she suggested this to the girls they were
happy to find that anything they owned could be
of use to Ruth. The cabin was hers, they told
her, for as long as she desired it.</p>

<p>So for the greater part of a day Ruth, Tom,
and their electricians spent their time at the cabin,
arranging the proper lighting for the important
interior scene.</p>

<p>When the work was finished and they were on
their way home, Ruth decided that she wanted to
look over the lighting arrangements once more.</p>

<p>Tom proposed that he return with her, but
Ruth begged him to go on to the settlement. She
might want to roam about the cabin and its environs
for some time and she knew that Tom was
very tired that day, having worked over his books
the night before until dawn.</p>

<p>Ruth became so absorbed in the work that the
lateness of the hour escaped her attention. Now,
as she once more came in sight of the Chase
house, she saw to her surprise that twilight was
stealing over the woods.</p>

<p>Was it this fact, she wondered, that made her
feel suddenly nervous and apprehensive? Certainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
she had been out on the edge of evening
many times before and had never experienced this
sensation.</p>

<p>She glanced about her uneasily, and as she did
so thought she saw a shadowy figure slip about
the corner of the cabin. Her breath coming
quickly, she hastened her steps and passed softly
around to the rear of the house, and crept to the
window.</p>

<p>What she saw there was enough to bring her
heart into her throat. There was a moment of
hesitation; then, swift as light, Ruth darted to
the kitchen door.</p>

<p>At the slight sound she made the stooped figure
of the man at the hearth straightened quickly.
With a venomous look at Ruth and a muttered
word he darted straight for her as she still stood
in the doorway.</p>

<p>Hardly knowing what she did, conscious only
of her necessity of stopping the rascal, Ruth
stepped back, and as he passed her with a snarl of
rage, put out her foot to trip him.</p>

<p>He came down heavily, for he was a large
man, and lay inert, stretched out on his face.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br>
<span class="fs80">DRAMA</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Alarmed by the commotion, Mary and Ellen
Chase came running from the inner room.</p>

<p>Ellen was trembling violently, the picture of
terror. But Mary’s chin was up and in her hand
she carried her father’s old shotgun!</p>

<p>“What is it, Miss Fielding? Oh, what has
happened? What have you done?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Ruth, trembling herself
now with the reaction and the fear that she had
injured the intruder more severely than she had
intended. “This man was trying to pry up a
stone of your hearth, Mary, and when he attempted
to escape I tripped him up. Come and
help me turn him over and see how badly he’s
hurt.”</p>

<p>“Is—do you suppose—he’s dead?” asked Mary
hesitantly, as she started to obey.</p>

<p>Before either of the girls could touch him the
man answered Mary’s question by turning over
of his own accord and trying rather waveringly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
to sit up, showing a large and swollen bump on
his head.</p>

<p>The girls stepped back, staring at him as
though he were some reptile.</p>

<p>“Lieberstein!” cried Mary, with all the contempt
and loathing she felt for this man in her
voice. “So it was you, was it? Again! Prying
and sneaking around like any common thief.
You’re lucky that you only got tripped up and hit
on the head. If I’d seen you first—” she did not
finish the sentence, but made a significant gesture
with her father’s old shotgun. “I’m not sure,”
she added with a grim expression on her girlish
face, “that I oughtn’t to use it yet!”</p>

<p>The man got unsteadily to his feet, holding to
the edge of the door casing for support.</p>

<p>“So you’re the one who tripped me up,” he
snarled to Ruth, ignoring Mary and her threatening
gun. “Well, young lady, the next time you
try it, you’ll wish you hadn’t.”</p>

<p>Ruth stepped close to him and in her eyes was
a glitter before which his own gaze fell sullenly
to the ground.</p>

<p>“And you might as well understand one thing,”
she said in an even tone. “These girls are not as
friendless and defenseless as you seem to think!
You and the man, or men, back of you stop annoying
them or you will be extremely sorry.”</p>

<p>Her scorn seemed to infuriate the man. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
lost all caution and for a moment the mean and
sinister soul of him peered forth for all to see.</p>

<p>“You think you’re smart, don’t you?” he
snarled. “Well, I’ll tell you something. If you
don’t watch out, Sol Bloomberg will get your
goat, and get it good, you—you——”</p>

<p>“Don’t dare call her names!” cried a valiant
voice, and Lieberstein whirled about to see himself
looking into the barrel of Mary’s weapon.</p>

<p>At that he lost what little self-control he had
left. He lunged at the girl and knocked up the
barrel of the gun just as Mary’s nerveless finger
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The shot went wild. At the same moment the
man was seized by the shoulder from behind and
sent whirling into the bushes.</p>

<p>“You swine!” cried the raging voice of Layton
Boardman. “Clear out of here before I use this
gun on you in earnest!”</p>

<p>He caught the gun from Mary, but before he
could raise it to his shoulder Lieberstein scuttled
off into the shrubbery with all the fleetness of a
frightened rabbit.</p>

<p>Boardman was laughing softly, but there was
no merriment in his mirth.</p>

<p>“The scoundrel!” he gritted. “Wish I’d used
the gun on him. Good mind to do it after all!”</p>

<p>He started forward toward the spot where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
Lieberstein disappeared. But Mary caught at his
arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, let him go! Let him go!” she cried.
“He won’t be back soon again. I—I think you
taught him a lesson, Mr. Boardman!”</p>

<p>Ruth went over to Ellen, who was sobbing
against the door frame and put an arm about her.
Then she turned to the actor.</p>

<p>“It was lucky for us that you came just then,
Mr. Boardman,” she said gravely. “Something
pretty dreadful might have happened if you
hadn’t.”</p>

<p>“I left my cap here the other day,” Boardman
explained, with his eyes still on Mary. “I was
coming back to get it.”</p>

<p>“Something must have sent you just at the right
time,” said Mary softly. “I shall always be
thankful for that.”</p>

<p>Ruth wanted the girls to come back with her
to Knockout Point, for that night at least. But
Mary refused, saying that they did not dare go
so far from the cabin.</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” she assured them, one arm
thrown about the trembling shoulders of her sister.
“You’re not to worry, really. We’re all
right! We are not ‘girl miners,’ as Eddie calls
us, for nothing. We know how to face things
and to fight.”</p>

<p>So Ruth and Boardman left them at last,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
though reluctantly, when they saw that Mary
could not be moved from her decision, and took
the long trail homeward almost in silence.</p>

<p>Once when they were nearing the settlement,
the actor clenched his hands and muttered as
though he were thinking aloud:</p>

<p>“I should have been quicker on the trigger!
I should have used that gun while it was in my
hands!”</p>

<p>It was then that Ruth told him how she had
happened to go back to the cottage and, seeing
Lieberstein busily engaged in examining the fireplace,
how she had interrupted him and then
thwarted his attempt at escape. Then she related
the subsequent hectic events up to the arrival
on the scene of Boardman himself.</p>

<p>By the look in his eyes, Ruth saw that she had
made one active ally for herself against the plottings
of Lieberstein and the man behind him, if
only for the sake of Mary Chase.</p>

<p>Nor were the days to follow free from annoying,
mysterious incidents.</p>

<p>At one time it was Boardman’s revolver that
was missing, and one had to be borrowed from
an extra who could manage to do without it.</p>

<p>At another time it was Alice Lytelly’s special
costume which it was necessary for her to wear
in certain scenes of the picture. This entailed a
hurried trip to the general store and a new dress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
made as near in the style of the original as possible.</p>

<p>As a result of these delays and hindrances not
only Ruth but the actors as well became nervous
and irritable.</p>

<p>“Lucky,” thought Ruth, grasping at what
straws of comfort she could find, “that most of
the biggest and most important scenes have
already been filmed. Sol Bloomberg at least
cannot spoil those!”</p>

<p>Which only goes to show that, even yet, Ruth
had no adequate idea of the lengths to which a
vindictive nature like Bloomberg’s would be willing
to go in order to cripple or disable an enemy.</p>

<p>One day Ruth and Helen took the long-contemplated
trip to the Chase mine. They had
arranged with Ellen to meet the latter at an early
hour and go with her to the mine, since Mary
would already be at work there.</p>

<p>They went on horseback to the little path leading
into the woods where Tom and Chess and
Layton Boardman had come upon Ruth and the
Chase girls on the occasion of Ruth’s first meeting
with them.</p>

<p>There Ellen met them and said that they had
better tether the horses in the woods since the
trail from there on was so rocky and steep that it
could only be ascended on foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>They led the horses some little distance from
the road and tethered them securely.</p>

<p>Both girls were in tune with the glorious day
and the beauty of the northern scenery. The
climb up the little path that wound about Snow
Mountain was a delight to them. New and beautiful
vistas opened up to them at every turn of
the trail.</p>

<p>Now they skirted sheer, precipitous descents,
where one misstep would mean almost certain
death. Again they plunged into heavy woodland
where wild flowers grew in a riot of color,
showing vivid faces even in the crevices of the
rocks.</p>

<p>“What I like about this country,” said Helen,
delighted, “is that you can have both summer
and winter at once. Here the air is as mild and
balmy as a southern spring, while up there—”
She did not finish the sentence, but instead, waved
her hand toward the shining crest of Snow
Mountain, dazzling in the light of the brilliant
northern sun.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful country,” agreed Ellen. “We
love it, Mary and I, even though it has not been
very kind to us.”</p>

<p>It was quite a long climb, and both Helen and
Ruth were considerably winded by the time they
reached the little shack far up on the side of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
the mountain which marked the location of the
Chase mine.</p>

<p>They found Mary and the old miners hard at
work near the choked-up mouth of the mine.
They were busy digging out débris with pickax
and shovel.</p>

<p>They had made good progress, but it seemed
to both Ruth and Helen that there was still a
discouragingly long way to go before the mouth
of the mine could be opened and the actual work
of gold-digging continued.</p>

<p>Mary’s eyes brightened when she saw them
and she came toward her new friends with hands
outstretched.</p>

<p>“You look tired,” she said. “It was a long
climb, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>They answered that it was, and then Mary introduced
the three old miners. They came forward
in a rather embarrassed group, a trio of
gnarled and weatherbeaten old fellows who had
spent a lifetime looking for a fortune that never
materialized.</p>

<p>They were self-conscious and shy in conversation
with Helen and Ruth and seemed glad when
they were able to return to their tedious and discouraging
labor.</p>

<p>“They will scarcely take any pay from us,”
said Mary in a low voice, tears in her eyes as she
looked at these loyal old friends. “They loved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
Dad and they feel sure if we can once get the
stones and débris cleared away we will find real
pay dirt.”</p>

<p>“Old Uncle Eddie has rheumatism,” said Ellen,
indicating one of the old men who limped painfully
when he walked. “He should have a doctor.”</p>

<p>“And we haven’t the money to pay one,” said
Mary sadly.</p>

<p>Later the girls took them to the little shack
and showed them a hidden jar half-filled with
gold dust that had been sifted from the sand.</p>

<p>“Dad found this before he died,” Mary told
her new friends, adding simply: “That is why
he was so sure the mine was good.”</p>

<p>But though Ruth and Helen stayed for some
time longer and tried to appear as encouraging
and cheerful as they could, they were in a saddened
and thoughtful mood as they took the long
trail homeward.</p>

<p>Ellen accompanied them again, in her capacity
of guide to the spot where they had left their
horses tethered; then said good-bye to them
swiftly and hurried back toward the cabin. She
had left some one in charge there, but was afraid
the guardian might be gone if she remained too
long away.</p>

<p>“They never will be able to do anything up at
the mine with the equipment they have,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
Helen, as she and Ruth cantered slowly on toward
Knockout Point. “It is like trying to catch
a whale with a bent pin on the end of a string.”</p>

<p>Ruth nodded.</p>

<p>“It is the most pathetic sight I ever saw,” she
said. “Those three old men working like slaves
for the girls just because they liked their
father——”</p>

<p>“And no money to pay a doctor for that poor
old fellow’s rheumatism,” Helen added. “I declare,
Ruth, if I thought the old man would take
it, I’d pay for the doctor myself!”</p>

<p>But though Ruth and Helen were both depressed
by their visit to the Chase mine, they
were glad that they had made it. It gave them
a better idea of the stupendous task before Mary
and Ellen Chase and increased their admiration
and respect for these plucky girls and the manner
in which they set about to overcome the obstacles
in their path.</p>

<p>That they were not the only ones to admire
the Chase girls Ruth was informed by Tom in a
laughing conversation they had a few days after
her trip to the Chase mine.</p>

<p>“Layton Boardman is in a bad way, poor
chap,” laughed Tom. He and Ruth were taking
a quiet stroll along the one main street of Knockout
Point after a busy day. “He confided to me
to-day that for a long time he was feeling queer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
and thought he was coming down with some sickness
or other. What was his surprise then, to
find it was only love!”</p>

<p>Ruth looked up at him, eyes suddenly eager, in
spite of her amusement.</p>

<p>“Tom! Then he is in love with Mary!”</p>

<p>Tom nodded.</p>

<p>“It affects ’em that way sometimes,” he said,
with a whimsical laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad,” said Ruth and added with
a fine enthusiasm: “She deserves all the good
luck that comes her way. She is the pluckiest
girl I know!”</p>

<p>“Except one!” said Tom, and looked at Ruth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ruth was working steadily on her
picture.</p>

<p>Despite the setbacks and nerve-racking delays,
several of the finishing outdoor scenes of minor
importance were filmed about the cabin and on
Snow Mountain. Ruth was beginning to hope
that all might yet be well.</p>

<p>Then, one day when she was out alone searching
for a new location on Snow Mountain, Ruth
stepped on something hard and the next moment
two sets of sharp, inexorable steel teeth clamped
upon her walking boot.</p>

<p>Feeling sick with shock and apprehension Ruth
looked down and found that her foot was tightly
caught in the jaws of a trap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>Lucky for her that her boots were made of
heavy, tough leather, or those cruel steel teeth
would have cut through to the bone.</p>

<p>As it was, the pressure was sickeningly painful.</p>

<p>With a little moan Ruth sank to the ground,
wrenching the trapped foot as she did so.</p>

<p>“This is too much,” she said aloud in her
anxiety. Looking up at the snow-crested top of
Snow Mountain she smiled a crooked twisted little
smile. “Snow Mountain! They say you bring
good luck. And I have had nothing but the worst
of luck ever since I saw you! I wish,” she cried,
with a sudden burst of helpless fury, “I had never
seen you!”</p>

<p>As the seconds raced into minutes and the minutes
dragged into hours and still no help came
to her, Ruth began to feel as though release
would never come.</p>

<p>She worked at the steel jaws of the trap, calmly
at first, then feverishly, until her fingers were
bruised and bleeding with the effort to free the
imprisoned foot.</p>

<p>It was of no use. She had known from the
first that she might as well try to push Snow
Mountain from its resting place as to attempt
to open the cruel trap with her bare fingers.</p>

<p>She was hungry and thirsty and utterly exhausted.
Would she have to spend the night
there? she wondered, dully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, back at headquarters, Tom had
heard news of vital importance to Ruth, news
that had sent him rushing grimly after her.</p>

<p>Luckily she had told him the general direction
of her wanderings, so that, once on his way, it
took him only a short time to find her.</p>

<p>His cries of “Ruth! Ruth! Where are you?”
brought an answering, sobbing cry from the girl.</p>

<p>His heart full of apprehension, Tom plunged
through the bushes in the direction of that pitiful
cry.</p>

<p>He found the girl huddled on the ground, her
face white and drawn with pain, a gallant smile
of welcome touching her pale lips.</p>

<p>He saw at once what the matter was and set to
work without waste of words to liberate the imprisoned
foot. He searched about until he found
two flat slabs of stone, then wedged these in between
the steel jaws of the cruel trap. He managed
at last, by exerting his utmost strength, to
loosen them just enough to permit Ruth to drag
her foot and ankle through.</p>

<p>“Lucky for me, Tom, that you happened along
just then,” she said unsteadily, as Tom stooped
gently to unlace the boot.</p>

<p>Something in his face as he glanced pityingly
at her warned the girl that all was not well.</p>

<p>“Tom!” she cried, clutching at his arm, a sudden
cold terror at her heart. “Something has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
happened! You can’t keep anything from me!
I know too well. Tom, please tell me!”</p>

<p>“Let’s wait till we see how the poor foot is,”
Tom muttered. He went on unlacing the boot
and kept his eyes resolutely averted from hers.</p>

<p>“Tom!” Her clutch on his arm was imperative,
frantic. “Whatever has happened that you
are afraid to tell me, don’t torture me by putting
it off this way. Can’t you see I must know at
once?”</p>

<p>Tom took her cold hand in both his own and
from that moment all pretense was gone. The
depth of his apprehension showed plainly in his
troubled face.</p>

<p>“You’re a brick, Ruth,” he said. “I know you
will take this standing as you have taken everything
else. But it’s a pretty tough one. Two
magazines of films have disappeared!”</p>

<span class="fs80">BLOOMBERG STRIKES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ruth looked at Tom for a moment, completely
stunned by the force of this revelation.</p>

<p>“Gone!” she exclaimed. “Tell me! Who
found out about the missing magazines and
when?”</p>

<p>“Bert Traymore—just a short time ago,” Tom
answered jerkily. He drew off the boot and saw
with a pang of pity that Ruth’s ankle was swollen
and puffy. “As soon as he told me I came to
find you.”</p>

<p>“Have you done anything—sent any one to
track down the thief?” Ruth’s voice was quiet
as she put the questions. No time now for hysteria,
she told herself sternly. This occasion
called for all the grit and stamina she possessed.
No need to ask who was at the bottom of the
theft. This was Bloomberg’s revenge—the blow
she had been waiting for and dreading ever since
she had heard that her enemy was at Knockout
Point. To outwit such a man as Bloomberg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
called for calm nerve and a cool mind. To give
way now would be merely to play into Sol Bloomberg’s
hands.</p>

<p>Tom nodded in reply to her question.</p>

<p>“I’ve already sent several of the boys to scout
about. And I’ve detailed a couple of them to
shadow Bloomberg and watch his slightest move.
By the way,” he looked up with the faintest grim
lifting of the corners of his mouth, “we have one
bit of startling information from the most promising
young detective in our midst.”</p>

<p>“Eben!” cried Ruth. “What is it, Tom? Oh,
hurry!”</p>

<p>“He says he saw Charlie Reid coming out of
The Big Chance the other evening. It was just
on the edge of dusk, and he says he can’t swear
to the man’s identity, but he’s just about certain
it was Reid. He lived in the same apartment
house with Reid a winter or so ago, and knows
the fellow. Of course,” Tom added, with a deprecating
shrug of his shoulders, “the kid’s mistaken.
Charlie Reid is safe in New York right
now.”</p>

<p>“No!” said Ruth quickly, “I believe Eben is
right, Tom; and I’ll tell you why.”</p>

<p>In short, jerky, breathless sentences she told
him then of the impression both she and Helen
had had that they were being followed and of
the two occasions when they had caught sight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
some one who looked strikingly like Charlie
Reid.</p>

<p>“So!” said Tom, his eyes narrowed to a steely
glitter. “We have <em>that</em> rascal to deal with, too,
have we? Well, the more the merrier!”</p>

<p>“You—you don’t think the ankle is broken, do
you, Tom?” she asked, regarding the injured
member anxiously. “It—it wiggles!”</p>

<p>“Then it isn’t broken,” said Tom, admiring
her pluck and the unquenchable humor that never
failed her even in the most desperate predicament.
“I think it’s only bruised by the pressure, and
perhaps a strained tendon or two. Luckily I came
on horseback—and the mare’s husky enough to
carry us both.”</p>

<p>Before Ruth could protest he lifted her in his
arms and carried her over to the spot where he
had left his horse grazing on the stubby grass.</p>

<p>They rode back to Knockout Point to find the
entire company in a state of excitement and alarm.</p>

<p>Carried to her room by Tom, who still would
not let her put her foot to the ground, Ruth sent
at once for her assistant directors and the
cameramen.</p>

<p>“What you need is to rest for a little, Ruthie,”
protested Helen. To the latter and Chess, Tom
had explained briefly how he had found Ruth
and released her from the steel jaws of the trap.
“Your poor foot must pain you terribly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“It’s nothing!” cried Ruth, impatient of anything
that might delay her search for the missing
films. “By to-morrow the ankle will be well
again. But the magazines! Tom, why don’t
those people hurry?”</p>

<p>They came before she had finished speaking
the words—a solemn-visaged group of men, fully
realizing the gravity of the situation.</p>

<p>“Sit down, please,” she said curtly. “Now
please tell me whose fault it is that this thing happened
to-day. I suppose you know,” she added,
her steady gaze holding them, “just what it
means!”</p>

<p>“We know only too well, Miss Fielding,” said
Bert Traymore, with a worried frown. “We had
the take-up boxes locked in the big chest. There
was a padlock besides——”</p>

<p>“And that was forced as well as the lock,” said
Schultz.</p>

<p>“What was taken?” Ruth’s anxiety made the
words sting like the lash of a whip.</p>

<p>“Magazines seven and ten,” said Atwater,
and added in a gloomy voice, as though he
thought the worst might as well be told at once:
“Miss Lang’s big scene was in number ten.”</p>

<p>Ruth sprang to her feet; then knitted her brows
in an effort to keep back an exclamation of pain
and impatience. That ankle again!</p>

<p>“I must go at once and see—” she began, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
Tom interrupted her with more than his usual
firmness.</p>

<p>“You can’t go anywhere just now. See, you
can hardly walk!”</p>

<p>“Was there no clew to the thief?” asked Ruth,
after a moment.</p>

<p>“Nothing but a few greasy fingermarks, Miss
Fielding,” replied Schultz.</p>

<p>“But we’ve got to get back those films!” cried
Ruth, her eyes suddenly blazing in her white face
as she turned fiercely upon the three cameramen.
“You are responsible for the magazines. You
allowed two of them to be stolen. Now you’ve
got to get them back for me! Do you hear? Get
them back for me!”</p>

<p>When Schultz and Traymore and Atwater left
the conference some time later they were three
very much subdued and anxious men. No one
wanted more than they to recover the missing
magazines and no one knew better than they how
difficult, perhaps impossible, a task this would be.</p>

<p>For a long time after they had left her Ruth
sat silent in the big chair, chin on palm, eyes
brooding.</p>

<p>“It’s hard, hard luck, Helen,” she said, when
the latter would have comforted her. “Or rather,
I might say, it’s Bloomberg! He seems to have
been a little too clever for me, after all. My,
how tired I am!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>This mood of desolation lasted through a
phantom-filled, restless night, but was partially
dissolved by the sun of a brilliant northern day.
When the first rays of the sun streamed across
her face Ruth threw back the covers and anxiously
regarded her injured ankle.</p>

<p>“You aren’t nearly so swollen as you were yesterday,”
she said presumably addressing the
ankle. “And I don’t believe you will be nearly
so painful!”</p>

<p>Very gingerly and carefully she tested the truth
of this bold assertion, resting the foot lightly on
the floor, then adding more pressure when the
expected pain failed to register.</p>

<p>To her delight she found that she could walk.
The ankle was naturally still sore and painful, but
by hobbling and by taking the burden of her
weight mostly on the well foot she could manage
to get about without too much discomfort.</p>

<p>Pausing in the midst of these experiments to
find Helen’s eyes fixed sleepily upon her, Ruth
smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m only a make-believe cripple,” she cried,
with an attempt at gayety. “Who knows? Ruth
Fielding may defeat Sol Bloomberg yet!”</p>

<p>But though the injury to Ruth’s ankle was far
less serious than she had dared to hope, still the
young director found herself greatly handicapped
in the serious work of the day. It was plain to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
her that she must favor the ankle and go lightly
on it for that day at least. To use it too much
while it was still so tender meant that she might
be laid up for days to come.</p>

<p>“You and Chess will have to follow the thief,”
she told Tom after breakfast that morning. “If
Eben was right about seeing Charlie Reid at The
Big Chance, then I believe he is certainly the
fellow Bloomberg would employ and the man
you have to find. His trail ought still to be fresh
and comparatively easy to follow if you start at
once. Perhaps you may find the films and bring
them back to me by night. Oh, boys, please try!
You know what it means to me—to us, Tom!”</p>

<p>“We’ll get those films if it takes a leg!” promised
Tom.</p>

<p>“If it takes both of ’em!” Chess added vehemently.</p>

<p>The girls watched the two boys ride off in a
cloud of dust, waving to them until they could
no longer be seen.</p>

<p>In spite of Helen’s earnest efforts to keep her
chum quiet and save the ankle from further injury,
Ruth could not sit still. She was the victim
of an intolerable restlessness; inertia was positive
agony to her.</p>

<p>She had another conference with her cameramen.
They took her to the chest in which they
had locked up the precious, daylight loaded films.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>With lugubrious countenance Schultz, Traymore
and Atwater showed her the padlock that
had been forced in their absence, the place where
the stolen magazines had rested.</p>

<p>The films necessary for the day’s work of the
cameramen are contained in daylight loading
boxes, or magazines. These magazines are carefully
loaded in a dark room and so become daylight
loading in the camera. Ruth knew that in
the motion picture camera, these magazines are
interchangeable, the film passing out of the top
magazine through the mechanism of the camera
and into the lower magazine. Here it is wound
up and carefully protected against light, to be developed
later in the laboratory. The lower box
is called the “take-up magazine,” and when this
is removed the top magazine is put in its place
and a freshly loaded box takes the place of the
empty one.</p>

<p>It was two of these precious take-up magazines,
neatly labeled as to the exact nature of their contents,
that had been filched from the chest.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Ruth moodily, “why the thief
did not take them all?”</p>

<p>“If there were only one or two men operating
they could not get away with any more,” said
Traymore, haggard lines of worry on his usually
merry countenance. “I can’t tell you how sorry I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
am that this has happened, Miss Fielding. I
could hardly sleep last night——”</p>

<p>“I guess none of us could!” Again Ruth’s worry
made her words more brusque than she intended.
“We must have the locks replaced at once, and
please see that some one guards this chest night
and day from now on. Although,” she added unhappily,
speaking more to herself than to Traymore,
“it is very much like locking the stable after
the favorite colt is gone!”</p>

<p>After this conference it was impossible for
Ruth to remain quiet.</p>

<p>“Let’s get a couple of mounts somewhere and
ride up in the woods a way,” she suggested to
Helen. “Certainly that can’t hurt my miserable
old ankle.”</p>

<p>“We might ride as far as the Chase cabin,”
said Helen, a bit doubtfully. “They would be
glad to see you.”</p>

<p>“The very thing! I want to learn how they
are making out in protecting their claim.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess they are all right.”</p>

<p>“Let us hope so,” and Ruth sighed. “Oh, my,
what a lot of trouble all of us are having!” she
added.</p>

<span class="fs80">RUTH GOES TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In one or two of the minor scenes, Ruth had
been able to use Sandy Banks and Slick Jones as
extras. The two added a great deal to the local
color of the scenes in which they were used and
Ruth only regretted that she had not been able to
use them more frequently.</p>

<p>As it was, the money the young director had
given them in return for “enjoyin’ themselves,” as
they put it, had made them Ruth’s great friends.
As for Slick Jones, the best he had was none too
good for this favorite of his. The result was
that the girls now found themselves mounted on
a pair of gentle though high-spirited colts that
seemed aware of the distinguished company they
were in and carried themselves accordingly.</p>

<p>It was a relief to Ruth to be doing something
again. As the two girls cantered along through
the woods in the general direction of the Chase
cabin Ruth listened absently to Helen’s chatter.
Her actual thoughts were with the Chase girls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>They soon entered the tiny path that led to the
Chase cabin. Here the branches of the trees
swept so low that the girls were forced to dismount
and tie their horses and proceed the rest
of the distance on foot.</p>

<p>Ruth’s ankle was unexpectedly painful, and she
leaned rather heavily on Helen’s supporting arm
as they approached the cabin.</p>

<p>“Foolish child!” Helen was scolding. “You
have no business to be getting around at all to-day.
Serve you right if you were laid up for a
week after this escapade——”</p>

<p>“Sh-h!” warned Ruth, her fingers tightening
nervously on Helen’s arm. “There are voices inside
the cabin. Listen—a man’s voice!”</p>

<p>They stood still and listened, holding their
breath so as not to lose the slightest sound from
the cabin.</p>

<p>They were close now. There was the low,
heartbroken sound of a girl sobbing—Ellen probably—another
passionately raised woman’s voice
and the threatening growl of a man.</p>

<p>“A little closer!” urged Ruth, pulling Helen
toward the window where they might gain a
glimpse of the room.</p>

<p>Cautiously they approached the house, avoiding
the door so that no sudden rush from within
might take them by surprise. Stealing to one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
the windows they peered in and saw a tableau
that might have chilled the stoutest heart.</p>

<p>Ellen was crouched in the far corner of the
cabin, on her drawn young face an expression of
terror. Characteristically, Mary bravely held
the old shotgun, but her hands shook so—with
excitement as much as, or more than, with fear,
Ruth decided—that they could scarcely bear the
weight of it.</p>

<p>The third figure was that of a man. The girls
outside could not see his face, but even with his
back to them he suggested sickeningly the beast
of prey, stalking his victim relentlessly and about
to spring.</p>

<p>“Lieberstein!” whispered Ruth.</p>

<p>She shrank back from the window and faced
Helen, a fierce light in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Ride back to town, quick!” she cried. “Get
some of the boys and bring them here. I’ll try
to hold Lieberstein if I can!”</p>

<p>“But your ankle——”</p>

<p>“Never mind me!” cried Ruth. “Helen, please
don’t stop to argue! Those two girls need help!”</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll be back with some one in a
jiffy!”</p>

<p>In a flash she was off, running swiftly and
noiselessly toward the spot where they had left
the horses.</p>

<p>Ruth approached the window again and looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
in. She knew what Lieberstein had come after.
Mary had whispered to her only a short time before—having
come to know Ruth and to trust her—that
her father’s precious papers had been hidden
by Ellen and herself in an old cow horn back
of a loose stone in the hearth. But when Ruth
came upon Lieberstein prowling close to the hiding
place, Mary had become alarmed and hidden
the papers in a new spot. Where they were now
she had never revealed even to Ruth, for Mary
Chase had learned caution in a hard school!</p>

<p>Mary had been holding the shotgun, but as
Ruth looked, the bully wrenched it from her
hands and kicked it contemptuously into one corner
of the cabin.</p>

<p>He sneered at Mary and advanced toward her,
hands upraised threateningly.</p>

<p>“You’ll threaten me, will you, you little rat!”
Ruth heard him say. “Well, I told you, didn’t I,
that you’d get fresh with Max Lieberstein once
too often? I’m not goin’ to be put off any longer.
Now! will you tell me where you hid those papers
your Dad set such store by or won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I won’t!” cried Mary, undaunted, and reached
behind her for the cane her father had sometimes
used.</p>

<p>“Drop that!” ordered Lieberstein, and sprang
forward.</p>

<p>Ruth waited for no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>She hobbled as swiftly as she could on her painful
ankle to the door and cautiously opened it.
The two in the far corner of the room were too
engrossed to notice her. And Ellen, reaching
with trembling hands for a chair, seemed not to
see her either.</p>

<p>The shotgun lay before Ruth. In a flash inspiration
came to her. She stooped and picked
up the weapon, then retreated quickly toward the
door again.</p>

<p>“Hands up!” she cried in a clear, sharp voice.
“We’ve got you!”</p>

<p>The ruse worked. Taken completely by surprise
and thinking probably that the girl was followed
by a score of others, the cowardly rascal
whirled about, at the same time lifting his hands
above his head.</p>

<p>“Now,” cried Ruth, eyes blazing. “You utter
one more threat to that girl if you dare!”</p>

<p>By this time Lieberstein began to realize that
he had been the victim of a clever ruse. He had
been tricked, fooled, by a mere girl.</p>

<p>The fury of such a nature as Lieberstein’s beneath
such provocation can only be imagined.
He was white with rage, and advanced upon
Ruth with both fists upraised.</p>

<p>“You—you—” he sputtered. “I’ll show
you——”</p>

<p>But there was something about Ruth and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
attitude as she stood facing him that made him
pause despite himself. For in that moment the
anger of the young director quite matched Lieberstein’s.
And she possessed one great advantage
over him in that her mind became more
clear and calm the greater rage she felt and
functioned with an almost uncanny swiftness and
accuracy.</p>

<p>“Don’t come another step!” she commanded in
a voice that was as clear and cold as the dropping
of icicles. “Under the circumstances I wouldn’t
mind much if this gun did go off. And if you
come much closer, maybe it will. Keep that hand
up, please!”</p>

<p>The command was so sharp and was accompanied
by such a suggestive motion of the shotgun
that Lieberstein obeyed almost automatically.
His right hand that had been wandering toward
his belt joined the left above his head.</p>

<p>Ruth was excited and strangely exhilarated.
She was holding the scoundrel! If she could only
keep this up for a short time longer Helen would
be back with some one from Knockout Point.
Her ears strained for the sound of approaching
aid.</p>

<p>“You’ve got the drop on me this time,” snarled
Lieberstein, his face purple with rage. “Ruth
Fielding, the great director, on the job again!
You’d better keep out of this, you——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“Stop!”</p>

<p>It was Mary’s voice. She and Ellen had crept
close to Ruth. Mary grasped the heavy cane.
Ellen had raised the chair above her head, ready
for action.</p>

<p>“You stop!” cried Mary again, her eyes steely
as she looked at Lieberstein. “Ruth Fielding is
my friend. She has been kind to Ellen and me.
You are a fiend. Don’t you dare call her names.”</p>

<p>This new attack seemed to drive Lieberstein
beyond himself with fury. He ignored Ruth and
the shotgun and charged down upon Mary, face
livid.</p>

<p>“Hands up—you!”</p>

<p>Lieberstein whirled about.</p>

<p>In the doorway stood Layton Boardman!</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV<br>
<span class="fs80">BOARDMAN WAKES UP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Mary and Ellen Chase were as startled and
surprised to see Layton Boardman as Lieberstein
himself, though his interference meant something
quite different to them.</p>

<p>For a moment the eyes of Boardman and Mary
met, and that one look told more than a great
many words could have done. He moved a little
closer to the girl and then turned his attention
again to the cowering Lieberstein.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Ruth that, even in that
moment of strain and tense expectancy, the uppermost
thought in her mind was professional.</p>

<p>“Our leading man was never in better form in
his life,” was her unspoken comment upon the
scene. “What a picture this would make! Almost,”
with a whimsical smile, “true to life!”</p>

<p>As Boardman advanced into the cabin, driving
Lieberstein before him, they saw that he was not
alone. Helen followed him, breathless and disheveled,
but triumphant. After her came several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
young miners whom Ruth recognized as having
been much in Boardman’s company recently.</p>

<p>These gathered about the now cringing Lieberstein,
muttering threats and scowling at him.
One, more eager than the rest, reached out a hand
as though to seize the fellow by his collar, but
Boardman pushed him aside.</p>

<p>“Not yet, Nick!” he said. “We’ll give the cur
just one more chance. Now listen, you!” He
placed himself directly before Lieberstein and
forced the cowering, sullen fellow to meet his
eyes. “We’re telling you something to-day, and
a lapse of memory on the subject will cost you
your dog’s life. That’s as sure as that the sun
will come up to-morrow. Am I right, boys?”</p>

<p>There was an eager, growling assent from the
miners as they pressed a little closer.</p>

<p>“We’re givin’ you just one more chance to beat
it! You savvy?” As he often did when excited
or greatly moved, Boardman dropped back into
the cowboy dialect—a hangover from those wild
days on the ranch when his name was still unknown
to picturedom. “We’ve got a lot o’ patience,
but where you’re concerned, it’s wearin’
thin, brother. We don’t like you and we don’t
like your way of doin’ things. If we find you’ve
cleared out for good before sundown to-morrow,
you’ll have saved your yellow skin. But if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
don’t take our advice, why— You tell him, fellows!”
turning to his companions.</p>

<p>“The nearest tree!” said one.</p>

<p>“And a good stout rope!” added another.</p>

<p>Still a third made a significant gesture with
both hands, a gesture strongly reminiscent of the
twisted neck of a barnyard fowl.</p>

<p>While Ruth felt sure that these threats were
made simply for the purpose of frightening the
cowardly Lieberstein from the neighborhood of
Knockout Point, the gestures of the young miners
were vivid enough to make her feel uncomfortable.
And she was conscious all of a sudden
that she was very tired and that her ankle was
paining her.</p>

<p>Lieberstein’s face was a study of conflicting
emotions.</p>

<p>“I’ll get out!” he muttered, with an ugly look.
“You bunch of——”</p>

<p>Boardman took a menacing step forward and
there was a deep grumble from the others.</p>

<p>“You might,” suggested the actor gently, his
eyes again narrowed to a steely glitter, “try
beatin’ it now. Brother, I’m goin’ to start
countin’ five——”</p>

<p>He started counting, still in that gentle drawl,
marking off the counts on his fingers.</p>

<p>Lieberstein, crouching now like a cornered animal,
seemed about to spring upon his tormentor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
But the odds were too heavy against
him. As Boardman’s soft voice drawled out the
number “four,” he turned and bolted from the
place.</p>

<p>The others followed him to the door of the
cabin, Mary still clinging to Boardman, and
heard him crash off through the bushes. Like
hunting dogs balked of their quarry, the miners
started after him.</p>

<p>“No funny business, boys!” Boardman warned
them. “Just see where he goes and <em>that</em> he goes.
If he is still in the settlement to-morrow, bring
him to me!”</p>

<p>Then Layton Boardman turned to Mary Chase
and drew her to him.</p>

<p>“Your worries are all over, girl,” Ruth and
Helen heard him murmur softly. “You can put
away your dad’s old shotgun in the darkest corner
you’ve got. For you’re never going to need it any
more!”</p>

<p>“The close-up,” murmured Ruth to Helen, as
they turned away.</p>

<p>“And for us,” Helen finished whimsically, “the
fade-out!”</p>

<p>So it was that the problem of Mary Chase and
her sister Ellen was a problem no longer, even
though the affairs of “the girl miners of Snow
Mountain,” as Eddie Jones called them, still
needed adjusting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>Max Lieberstein left Knockout Point on the
very night of the trouble at the cabin. Evidently
he realized that Boardman and his friends meant
very serious business.</p>

<p>In a day or so Boardman met Mr. Knowles
again. The old gentleman had accomplished
something for his young friends—and a very important
something it turned out to be.</p>

<p>He had brought a man from Dawson City to
look over the Chase mine and ascertain whether
it was as valuable as its owner had thought it to
be before his death.</p>

<p>The report of this man was such as to raise
the girls to the seventh heaven of delight. According
to this expert the Chase mine was a rich
one.</p>

<p>“It’s all your doing, Ruth Fielding!” said
Mary, on one occasion when Ruth again visited
the cabin and heard the great news. “Our dear
old friends up at the mine are crazy with delight
over our good fortune.”</p>

<p>“It’s theirs, too, now,” said Ellen. “Or part
of it.” And she went on to tell that she and
Mary had decided to turn over a part interest in
the mine to the three old men who had been so
loyal to them in the time of their trouble.</p>

<p>“Uncle Eddie can have that famous doctor up
from Seattle to see him now,” she finished.
“When we told him, he—he cried!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“We all did,” confessed Mary, with a smile.
“I guess you would have thought we were all
crazy if you could have seen us when we got the
good news.”</p>

<p>“We all joined hands and danced around like
mad, even Uncle Eddie,” said Ellen, adding with
a chuckle: “Then we all sat down and cried.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure but what I’m going to weep,
too,” cried Ruth, with eyes suspiciously bright.
“Just to be in the swim, you know.”</p>

<p>But in her solitary moments Ruth was not at
all gay. The problem of the Chase girls was
definitely removed from her mind, but she was
still living through one of the most trying times
of her life.</p>

<p>Although Chess and Tom had thoroughly
searched the settlement and its vicinity, had faithfully
followed up the slightest clew, there was
still no trace of the missing film magazines.</p>

<p>Without them the picture as a whole was
ruined. They contained the best, the most powerful
scenes of the play. Edith Lang’s big scene,
reënacted after the first failure, was one of them.
Several scenes with Carlton Brewer, the man who
had taken the place of the dwarf, Joe Rumph,
were also among those missing.</p>

<p>Brewer had been fine in those scenes, too.
Neither Ruth’s confidence in the cleverness of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
make-up man, Abe Levy, nor in the ability of the
actor had been misplaced.</p>

<p>Brewer had acted the part of the cripple powerfully
and well. Where Joe Rumph had over-emphasized
the part, he emphasized it just enough.
In fact, he fitted in so admirably with her conception
of the part as it should be played that
Ruth was delighted and more than ever confident
of the wisdom of her choice.</p>

<p>Now these scenes were gone! The thief with
wicked and unerring cunning had taken the very
heart of the play. And the worst of it was that
there was no time for a retake, even if it were
possible to do the scene as well a second time.</p>

<p>The Yukon’s open season was wearing on.
Only in summer, when the ice in the river disappears
for a few short weeks, is the river navigable.
Winter comes suddenly and soon in
Alaska, and those who linger too long are apt to
wake up some morning to find the river blocked
with ice and themselves marooned for no one
knows how long.</p>

<p>None of the actors cared to remain in Alaska
over the severe winter. And besides, Alice Lytelly
was wanted in Hollywood.</p>

<p>No, there would be no time for the refilming
of those important scenes. That, Ruth knew,
was definitely out of the question. Her one
chance lay in finding the lost films—and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
chance, even Tom and the optimistic Chess, began
to think was exceedingly slim.</p>

<p>And to fail here meant only one thing, that
for the first time in her film career Ruth must face
defeat!</p>

<p>Knowing this, Ruth wondered how she found
the courage to go on at all. But on she did go,
just the same, automatically directing the last
few scenes on Snow Mountain until all were at
last complete.</p>

<p>The picture was finished and, more than that,
in every way it lived up to Ruth’s own high standards.
And—the heart of it was gone!</p>

<p>Tom felt that Bloomberg might have another
reason for the theft of Ruth’s films, besides the
obvious one of attempting to ruin her picture.</p>

<p>“He may think it’s a good chance to make some
easy money,” he said. “Bloomberg may simply
have hidden the films and then, when he gets
ready, will demand money for the return of
them.”</p>

<p>One day when Tom and Chess were off on their
indefatigable search and Ruth had started off
alone to walk and indulge her gloomy thoughts,
she saw a rider dashing toward her through a
cloud of dust.</p>

<p>The man drew rein close to her and held out
a torn and dirty scrap of paper.</p>

<p>“I found this wrapped around a stone and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
thrown into the middle of the road,” he told her,
panting. “I guess, ma’am, it’s meant for you.”</p>

<p>Ruth opened the crumpled scrap of paper addressed
to her with trembling fingers.</p>

<p>On it were scrawled a few words in writing she
recognized as Tom’s.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Prisoners in a cabin at lower end of Bear
Creek. Help us!”</p>
</div>

<p>The signature, scarcely legible, was, “Tom.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br>
<span class="fs80">THE RECKONING</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Ruth stared at the crumpled bit of paper for
a moment of quick thought.</p>

<p>It was evident that Tom and Chess had stumbled
into a trap of some sort. It might be a trap
deliberately set by Bloomberg and his tools. Or
it might have been—and here Ruth’s breath
caught in a gasp of hope—that the boys had
struck a real trail at last and stumbled upon the
hiding place of the films.</p>

<p>At any rate, there was no time to be lost. Tom
and Chess were probably both in deadly peril.
She must get help to them at once!</p>

<p>She turned swiftly to the man who had brought
the message.</p>

<p>He was one of Boardman’s friends and admirers—a
miner who had been a cowboy in the
same territory in the actor’s ranching days. Now
he had quieted his horse and stood at a little distance
from Ruth, eager to serve, but respectful.</p>

<p>“Can you get together a few men,” she asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
him breathlessly. “Perhaps the same that ran
Max Lieberstein out of town? It seemed to me,”
she added, by way of hurried explanation, “that
they were brave resolute men, and that’s the kind
we’ll need just now.”</p>

<p>“Reckon I can get all you want, ma’am,” the
lad replied eagerly. Then, hesitating: “It’s
about Mr. Cameron, ain’t it, ma’am?”</p>

<p>“He and his friend are prisoners,” answered
Ruth. “Here!” and she thrust the crumpled
paper into his hands. “Read this!”</p>

<p>The young fellow read the brief message,
frowning. A grim smile touched the corners of
his mouth as he handed the paper back to Ruth.</p>

<p>“Guess we know whose work this is, ma’am,”
he said, and added as he sprang to his horse and
wheeled it about: “I’ll fetch the boys.”</p>

<p>“Meet me at Knockout Inn,” gasped Ruth. “I
want to get Mr. Boardman, too.”</p>

<p>The miner nodded and was off in a cloud of
dust.</p>

<p>Ruth hurried back to the inn, her mind awhirl
with confused and torturing thoughts.</p>

<p>How had Tom and Chess stumbled into the
lion’s den? Had it been a trap set for them by
Bloomberg? Or had they actually discovered
the hiding place of the films and because of this
been captured and held by the enemy?</p>

<p>Useless to ask herself these questions now.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
The thing to do—the only thing to do—was to
reach the boys at once, to rescue them before the
vindictive Bloomberg and his confederates, thinking
perhaps that Tom and Chess knew too much
concerning the whereabouts of the films, might
do their prisoners some serious injury.</p>

<p>The films! The films! Her precious films!
Ruth clenched her hands against the hope that
she might recover them after all. She must not
torture herself with hopes for which there was,
as yet, no real foundation.</p>

<p>Tom and Chess were in trouble, perhaps desperate
trouble. She must think of them exclusively
now.</p>

<p>Arrived at Knockout Inn she found that Kid
Curry, the lad who had brought her the message
from Tom, had already arrived with “the boys.”
Curry was explaining the situation to Layton
Boardman in curt, gruff sentences when Ruth
came up to them.</p>

<p>Helen flew down the steps of the inn and flung
her arms about her chum.</p>

<p>“Ruth!” she cried, her pretty face drawn with
anxiety, “what is this I hear about the boys?”</p>

<p>“Let’s get started and I’ll tell you,” said Ruth.
She scarcely knew her own voice, it sounded so
strained and queer.</p>

<p>Boardman came up to her, chin thrust out, his
determined eyes gleaming under heavy brows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll get them, Miss Fielding!” he promised
grimly. “There is not a man here but what has
some private and personal grudge against Bloomberg.
May the Fates help him if we lay hands
on him to-day!”</p>

<p>“Then let us hurry—hurry!” begged Ruth passionately.
“We must not waste a moment! Are
you all ready?”</p>

<p>“Ready!” cried Boardman, and there came
eager assent from the men.</p>

<p>At Boardman’s request, two horses had been
made ready for the girls. They sprang to the
saddle and intimated by slackened rein that the
animals might set their own pace.</p>

<p>It was a good one, and as the posse dashed
along the dusty road it presented a formidable
appearance.</p>

<p>“Mean business, Slick, I reckon,” said Sandy
Banks, twirling the upturning ends of his magnificent
mustache thoughtfully. “Wouldn’t care
to be in that Bloomberg’s shoes, no way you might
look at it.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to be in Bloomberg’s pocket though,”
said the mournful Slick Jones, feeling ruefully of
his own flat wallet. “Might get back some of
what’s owing me from that there sneakin’ crook.
You can take it from me, my lad, that whatever
Sol Bloomberg gets, it ain’t one, two, three to
what’s owin’ him!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Boardman and Kid Curry had
taken the lead in the rescue party.</p>

<p>“You know Bear Creek better than I do,”
Ruth explained. Then, as she felt again the urge
of haste: “Oh, we must hurry! Hurry!”</p>

<p>But when they had nearly reached their destination
it was Ruth who again took the lead. She
knew that the cabin must be approached with
great caution. To warn Bloomberg of their approach
would rob their attack of the great advantage
it now possessed, the element of surprise.</p>

<p>The party proceeded cautiously on foot, Helen
and Ruth close together, the men following one
by one, as stealthy and grim as Indians. Not so
much as a snapped twig betrayed their approach.</p>

<p>“There’s the cabin,” Helen whispered suddenly,
as a tumble-down hut loomed through the thinning
shrubbery. “Oh, Ruth,” with a moment of
sheer panic, “what is happening to Chess—to
Tom—inside that place!”</p>

<p>“Sh-h!” whispered Ruth. “Helen, dear, we
shall soon find out!”</p>

<p>Ruth Fielding was trembling with excitement.
Her knees felt weak, unable to bear her weight.
But she forced herself to go forward, praying a
little wildly beneath her breath.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lord, keep them safe! Just a little
longer—just a moment longer—” Her dry lips
formed the words but no sound came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>They reached the cabin and managed, in accordance
with a whispered command from Layton
Boardman, to surround it without disturbing
whoever might be within.</p>

<p>Her heart pounding in her throat, Ruth crept
close to a window and looked within. Helen was
close beside her. Her cold hand stole into Ruth’s
and held it tight.</p>

<p>The pane was so encrusted with dirt that for a
moment it was impossible to see what was within
the room. Then one by one objects began to
stand out more clearly.</p>

<p>Tom and Chess were lying on the floor, hands
bound behind them. Their clothing was disheveled,
their faces encrusted with dirt. Grouped
about them in various attitudes were three men—Sol
Bloomberg, chewing his inevitable unlighted
cigar and evidently taking huge delight in the
proceedings; Joe Rumph, scowling, grotesque,
hideous in his deformity; and—Charlie Reid!</p>

<p>Then, Charlie Reid had followed them all the
way from New York! It had been Charlie Reid,
then, and no other, whom Eben Howe had seen
furtively leaving the door of Knockout Inn! It
was Charlie Reid, too, in all probability, who had
stolen the films, acting, as always, as the tool of
Sol Bloomberg!</p>

<p>“So!” the girls heard Bloomberg say, his oily
voice thick and gloating with triumph, “you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
thought you would be so smart, didn’t you?
What good has it done you to find the films? I
ask you that?”</p>

<p>Ruth’s heart leaped at the words and she
gripped Helen’s arm.</p>

<p>“By the time your friends find you,” Bloomberg’s
mocking voice went on, “those films will be
where you cannot touch them—and me also.
Where will your great Ruth Fielding be then, I
ask you——”</p>

<p>“Right here, Sol Bloomberg!” Ruth spoke
from the open doorway, her head held high, eyes
flashing. Behind her stood Layton Boardman
and several of the miners. “And now,” her voice
rang through the place, “where are my films?”</p>

<p>Bloomberg stared as though he had seen a
ghost. His cigar hung limp from flaccid lips.
Then with a roar like a wounded bull, he sprang
to his feet and dashed for the window.</p>

<p>The move was so sudden and catlike that the
rascal was fairly through the window before any
one could move to stop him.</p>

<p>The next moment there came a report, followed
by a cry of rage and pain. Ruth and Helen
rushed to the window. Bloomberg was prostrate
on the ground, blood streaming from a wound in
his leg. Above him stood Kid Curry, the smoking
revolver still in his hand.</p>

<p>“You will tote two aces, you sneakin’ crook!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
growled the lad, touching the wounded man contemptuously
with his foot. “Next time maybe I
won’t shoot so low!”</p>

<p>Ruth turned back into the room. Her hands
were clenched, her mouth felt dry.</p>

<p>It took only a glance to show her that both
Rumph and Charlie Reid were in the hands of
Boardman and his men.</p>

<p>She rushed over to Tom. He had struggled
to a sitting position and was trying to spit out the
filthy rag that gagged him.</p>

<p>With the aid of Boardman’s knife, Ruth freed
him.</p>

<p>“Tom, what have they done to you? Are you
hurt? Oh, Tom!”</p>

<p>“I’m all right,” said Tom thickly, his tongue
swollen and cracked. “Get the—films——”</p>

<p>“The films!” gasped Ruth. “Where, Tom?”</p>

<p>Tom nodded toward the farther end of the
room.</p>

<p>“Trapdoor,” he muttered. “Uneven place—pry
up—films there——”</p>

<p>Before he had finished Ruth and Boardman
were down on their knees beside the place Tom
indicated. It took them only a moment to find
the uneven spot in the flooring—another to lift
the loosened section and disclose the hole beneath!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>Ruth gave a strangled laugh and plunged her
hand into the aperture.</p>

<p>“The films!” she cried. “My precious films!
Tom—Helen—I think I’ll just die—of joy!”</p>

<p>“‘The Girl of Gold,’” said Layton Boardman,
looking gravely down upon her, “is saved!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Such rejoicing as there was at Knockout Point
that night!</p>

<p>Tom and Chess appeared little the worse for
the wear and tear of their harrowing experience.
Stiff and sore they were, for a fact, but so elated
over the success of their detective work that a
few small bodily ills meant nothing to them.</p>

<p>They had, it appeared, chanced to see Charlie
Reid emerge from the back door of The Big
Chance. The fellow had glanced furtively along
the street, but had not looked up to the second
story window of a near-by building where Tom
and Chess were, talking and joking with Sandy
Banks. The two young men had hurried down
the stairs and had followed Reid to the cabin and
had crept upon him as he was in the act of looking
into the hiding place of the films, apparently to
see if they were still safe.</p>

<p>But suddenly, just when they had seemed in
sight of victory, they had been set upon from behind
by Bloomberg and the powerful Rumph.
They had both been knocked out by a vicious blow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
on the head and when they came back to consciousness
found themselves gagged and bound.</p>

<p>“I managed to get my hands loose,” said Tom,
“and when nobody was looking scribbled the note
to you, Ruth. I had to wait until they had turned
their backs for a minute, and then I chucked the
note wrapped in a stone I found on the cabin floor
as far out of the door as I could. It must have
landed pretty far down the ravine and it was just
luck that any one found it.”</p>

<p>Every one was hilarious, especially the cameramen,
who insisted on having a special feast that
night at Knockout Point, for which they would
stand treat.</p>

<p>“Anything up to a million dollars,” cried Bert
Traymore, slapping Tom on the back. “That’s
the way I feel to-night!”</p>

<p>“Glad to get your films back?” Tom asked a
little later, as he stood close to Ruth, smiling at
the merry scene. “Just a little?”</p>

<p>“And how about getting you back?” asked
Ruth, her eyes full of gratitude as she lifted them
to Tom. “You took such risks, Tom—you and
Chess. I am so thankful we got to the cabin—in
time!</p>

<p>“And Snow Mountain,” she added softly, after
a short pause filled with pleasant thoughts, “<em>is</em>
lucky, after all!”</p>

<p>Some time had passed since that dramatic scene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
in the tumble-down cabin near Knockout Point—time
enough to permit Ruth and her company to
accomplish the return journey through the wonderful
country of blue glaciers and midnight sun
back to Seattle and from there by the more prosaic
overland route to New York.</p>

<p>They came triumphantly, bearing with them
the completed film version of “The Girl of
Gold.”</p>

<p>Bloomberg had been taken to a hospital at
Dawson City, there to await trial for theft when
he had sufficiently recovered from his wound.
Charlie Reid and Joe Rumph were also under restraint,
to be tried as his confederates.</p>

<p>“Didn’t I tell you we could beat the whole
pack of them?” Tom said once, when the company
were nearing New York. “Neither Bloomberg
nor Charlie Reid will bother you for some
time to come.”</p>

<p>“Which,” Ruth answered with a sigh of utter
content, “is a tremendous comfort to me, Tommy-boy!”</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond was on hand in New York to
greet Ruth with hearty enthusiasm and congratulations.</p>

<p>“Wait till you see the film before you praise
me too much,” Ruth warned him, laughing.</p>

<p>“We’ll arrange for a special view at once,”
Mr. Hammond told her. “But meanwhile, Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
Ruth Fielding, if <em>you</em> say the film is good, I am
quite willing to take your word.”</p>

<p>Within a few days after their return to New
York, Ruth and Tom and some members of their
company, together with Helen and Chess, found
themselves assembled in the projection room for
a private view of “The Girl of Gold.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond was there, of course, and the
same group of men who had first met Ruth in his
office, including Jim McCarty and the dubious
Raymond Howell. Ruth had descried the author
of the book, too, who came in late just as
the lights went down. No wonder the hand of
the young director was cold as she slipped it into
Helen’s.</p>

<p>“Don’t be nervous, honey,” said the latter,
with a warm squeeze of the hand. “As our
friend, Mary Chase, would say, ‘you have no call
to be!’”</p>

<p>“I had a letter from Mary to-day,” Ruth answered.
“She says the men that Mr. Knowles
and Layton Boardman set to working the mine
have found it richer in gold than they originally
supposed. She is coming on with Ellen as soon
as she can leave the mine——”</p>

<p>“And then Mary and your handsome actor will
be married,” concluded Helen happily. “What a
darling little romance we stumbled into, Ruth
Fielding!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>“Hush!” said Ruth, pressing her fingers. “It
has started!”</p>

<p>When the lights went up again Ruth was surrounded
by an enthusiastic group of actors, directors
and friends.</p>

<p>Mr. Hammond pushed his way through them
and held out his hand.</p>

<p>“The best you have ever done, Ruth Fielding!”
he said. “You have convinced even the most skeptical.
I can’t,” with a ring of true emotion in his
voice, “ever thank you enough.”</p>

<p>“Your enthusiasm is all the thanks I want,”
cried Ruth, eyes shining.</p>

<p>But when the author of the book himself found
his way to Ruth and told her that he would not
have a scene, a gesture, changed, it seemed to
Ruth that her cup of happiness was full.</p>

<p>It was a long, long time before Tom could separate
her from the group of her ardent admirers
and say a word alone to her.</p>

<p>“It was great, Ruth,” he told her, with enthusiasm.
“You’ve done what no other person in this
room could do!”</p>

<p>“With your help, Tom,” the girl reminded him
gently. “The picture would have been ruined,
you know, if you—and Chess—had not recovered
the stolen films.”</p>

<p>Her glance chanced to rest upon Chess and
Helen. Under cover of the general excitement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
the two were holding hands like a couple of children.
They were quite patently absorbed in each
other.</p>

<p>Ruth laughed as a whimsical recollection
crossed her mind.</p>

<p>“I thought Chess was going to the Yukon on
business!” she said. “To me the business end of
it seemed conspicuous by its absence!”</p>

<p>Tom grinned.</p>

<p>“Chess believes in never letting business interfere
with pleasure,” he said. “Anyway, we all
had a good time,” looking down at her. “Didn’t
we?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Ruth, rousing herself from a
dreamy musing. “We did, Tom. But the ending
is the best of all!”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
